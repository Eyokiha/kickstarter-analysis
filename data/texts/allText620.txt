Risks and challenges Safety concerns: We are developing a user model that is safe and trustworthy to both user and service provider. We are currently working with a company who provides complete safety background checks to help us develop safety measures such as screening of Fit2U instructors and ID-validation of user profiles. Models used by other industries (such as online dating services) are providing more opportunities and information for us that help overcome safety concerns. Supply matching demand: In our ramp up toward launch and implementation, we have been steadily recruiting instructors. Fit2U is fortunate to be able to leverage the instructor pool from sister company, Workouttemps to help supply enough qualified instructors to satisfy incoming requests. Our Team Leaders proactively are recruiting nationally and we attend several fitness industry conventions, such as the Idea Fitness Show to keep up to date with fitness trends and increase supply chains. Fit2U is a member of some of the largest associations for fitness instructors,allowing us access to scout new talent. Future Expansion Plans: Fit2U will launch in California and expand throughout the Westcoast, and then aim to expand on the EastCoast, following with the Midwest and South. Once Fit2U has a stable national presence, we will explore International opportunities. Fit2u will expand carefully and strategically always making sure we have sufficient supply for demand. Our service must be on point. At Fit2U, we love what we do and our leaders are industry professionals. Health and wellness opportunities continue to grow exponentially and with the introduction of Fit2U App, we actively further opportunities. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
