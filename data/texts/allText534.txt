Secure your placement at Central Supplies Management Company and support the For an Eye project by donating now! For an Eye is a dark comedy about revenge. It tells the story of Francis, an introverted 30-something, as he starts his new job at the surreal offices of the Central Supplies Management Company. On his first day Francis encounters his new co-worker Theo, the man who accidentally blinded Francis in one eye when they were schoolchildren. Through Francis’ eye we follow Theo’s erratic attempts to make amends, but we see that our anti-hero has neither forgiven, nor forgotten. Risks and challenges Time is not on our side as we have less than two months until our shoot, however we are extremely driven and are confident that we can make this happen with your help! We will of course keep fundraising after the shoot if we have not reached our target so that we can supplement the budget personally, and then pay ourselves back (people gotta eat!). We have contracts for all our actors and locations who sign on. We like to do things by the book to make sure we avoid any mishaps! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
