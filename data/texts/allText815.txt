We will not have any issues in reporting such things to law enforcement agencies to keep our SafeWeb.email community members safe. Why are we starting SafeWeb.email?We have found the world email system to be full of people that like to set up email addresses just for illegal usage, almost every person that has an email address should know what we are saying.You can never be really sure if you are in fact dealing with a real person or business and the chances are you are not!Anyone can set up an abusive email address and the services that provide these services cannot be contacted to report scammers & spammers and even when you can contact a provider they cannot do anything or couldn't care how people use their services.Our own research has showed mostly all providers are using your emails to use the contents of your emails to sell ads to you, there is no such thing as privacy on the internet anymore. It is all about getting as many details about you to target ads to you, an email service may seem free, however the real price you pay is your privacy so you can be sold ads or your details are sold to the highest bidder to spam & scam you!We want to create an email service where your safety & privacy is number one! We will never sell your email address or personal details that happens more than people think or use your details to sell things you never need or want.There is not one email service available on the internet where you must verify who you are, unless you are getting an email though your phone/internet company, however when you want to change phone/internet providers you have the major issue of changing your email address to all your contacts.An abusive email address is typically one that is used intentionally or unintentionally to harm internet users in terms of financial losses, data theft or generally abusive activity of scams, spam, phishing, adware and viruses.We cannot stop people sending unwanted and abusive emails to you though our forwarding SafeWeb.email system, be ensured when you report such email addresses of these people to us we will keep a record of these abusive email addresses and block these email addresses at a later date, when our system can block email addresses, it will not stop people creating new abusive email addresses, however it will keep the whole SafeWeb.email community from getting emails for known email addresses that are abusive to our users.How will the funds from this project be used?We need to secure our postal Locked Bag with Australia Post to provide our users a safe and secure postal address to send your details to set up your account.We need to secure our EV SSL (https) for the SafeWeb.email website.
