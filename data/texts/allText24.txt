Hey everyone! This summer (July-August) I'm doing a month long trip to Europe! The countries I will be visiting are: Iceland, England, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and France. And I know that many of you can be pretty busy with work and family and everything else going, which can sometimes prevent you from travelling. Which is why I'm starting this Kickstarter, in order to show you some of the best places on Earth. I will be spending 95% of my time taking both photos and videos from the places I'm visiting. If you'd like to see some of my current work please feel free to click the links below to see my videos or my photos.All the money is going to covering costs to get you your pictures/videos, also I'll be hiring a friend to make custom music for the high quality 4k videos of Iceland and Europe.

To do that, I'll be planning my trip months in advance, mapping out where to spend the most of my time to get the best pictures for all of you! There's always a risk when travelling but I'll be sure to bring the best pictures back! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
