The life of a traveling distance runner,put into the hands of the viewer/investor.Funds raised go towards travel an resources required to make the experience possible.I travel to places viewers/investors want to see perhaps to run a race or trails potential mountains.Packed with a camera for photography some moments captured via viewer control then printed an shipped to the viewer.Live streaming during travel put in the hands of the viewer.not just reading tweets or posts.I'm seeking to put the experience in the viewers hands fully interactive.all within the guidelines of law an safety.Won't just capture a runners life but comedy,music ,foods,urban art,to name a few.Life in motion even if that involves emotions.Travel destinations can be selected through voting;leaving potential hostile territories out of the equation.Seeking through success to pilot this to TV networks for a shot at a seasoned series show.Maybe there are places you'd love to see but just cant travel too for whatever the reason may be camera.Images online fall short an you'd like more control of what you see.Running is just my outlet an has already taken me to beautiful locations which I've captured behind the cameralens.I'd like to give some proceeds back to some yet to be determined charities.in ways my suffering or joys covering miles is your reward.So lets invest in something interactive an ground breaking giving us the chance to show some of the beauty hidden in this world.. Risks and challenges As always with running there are potential injury issues to contest with.Travel issues may come into play.software issues and or internet connectivity issues.If this project does take off an go well beyond its projected funding goal it is understood that would result in multiple investors all with potentially different travel destinations in mind.leaving the decisions to be decided through an implemented voting system along with multiple web series.The end game result of this venture is to get the series picked up by TV an turned into a series there perhaps on a travel/destination channel.The success of this will an always be in the hands of the investors/viewers.through word of mouth or social media promotion.Locations experience an editing have a strong effect indeed but a positive user experience is what is in mind. Seeking to implement a interactive web media experiences will always have its risks an limitations but not every company has the emotion to respect their consumer.
