I am looking to bring a nostalgia back into today's world. A place for families to have that unique dinning experience with children, a hangout for local college students, a gathering place for fun, music, classic cars, car shows, and don't forget great food, deserts and ice cream with dining both inside and out. Don'f forget the car hops!Decorated in the true 50's style, waitresses and waiters in transitional 50's diner uniforms, classic 50's music and more. Bringing traditions back to small town Tennessee The funding will allow for the retrofit of garage style building to the 50's decor and equipment to ensure quality service. Along with traditional 50's drive in food, the customers IT'S ALL SUGAR (4ft'8" x 2"0" will be able to order custom baked goods (see picture of custom cake attached) and hold parties for all events. It's going to be a rock'n good time. Please help me make this a reality,its going to be great! Once funded the process will start and all backers will be sent link to website and view progress. I might even let everyone help with selections of color scheme. Risks and challenges As with any business venture there are risks to over come. First of all you must stand out against competition by creating a unique experience but not a flash in the pan; second you need to use local sources for supplies and staff; 3rd you need to cherish your customers give them a memory that last with them; fourth strive for perfection. All of this is to be done with great professionalism, heart, soul, passion and convection. A vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare. I have assisted many family members start successful businesses; yet I have never reached for my own dream. I have worked in municipal government and the operation of others business to help them succeed. This time my dream will become a true reality. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
