Shooting high-quality on low budget is one of the most difficult feats for any filmmaker to accomplish… but, it happens to be SCF Productions specialty. We’ve shot over 50% of our film, paying out of pocket, and we are absolutely proud and even surprised at what we’ve been able to capture thus far. We want to keep up with our high-quality shoots during the filming of Remnants’ second half, but we need a bit of financial assistance this time. Check out our page Facebook.com/SummerCampFilms. We’re working on a few very cool projects and if you like what you see, throw some cash our way. Thanks, we won’t forget it! Risks and challenges SCF Productions has faced adversity, road bumps, hurdles etc. from day one. lt's more than difficult to find people who will see anything through these days. Unfortunately we've worked with more than a few of these people; we've been let down, stranded and double-crossed, but the one thing SCF always does is persevere.
