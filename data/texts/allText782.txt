HistoryMyWay is a socially immersive community which is seeking to help people explore the history around them and to engage other history aficionados around them. While many are familiar with larger historical venues, historically notable places abound and many are surprised to learn about all the smaller historical venues that exist that were hitherto unknown to them.The mobile app, for droid and ios, will be free for all who download and use it and will help people find our nation's rich history. I have spent hundreds of hours parsing the NRHP registry and have geocoded about 80000 plus locations. Risks and challenges The only risk is if websites/apps don't function correctly.
