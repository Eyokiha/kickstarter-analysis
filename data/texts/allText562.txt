We're trucking through the picture edit but still have a lot of work ahead. Our editor, sound designer, and colorist are passionate to get this project done, but a little financial support can make their jobs a lot easier. PLEASE DONATE IF YOU WANT US TO FINISH POST PRODUCTION SOONER THAN LATER!After Noon is Night interweaves the stories of a few unusual tenants living in a low-cost apartment building in downtown Los Angeles. In this glimpse into LA’s underbelly, you’ll meet construction workers longing for love, a meddling yogi healer and his uncomfortable Malibu clientele, an aging actress concerned for her future, and a post-collegiate pizza boy caught in the middle of four angry working women and a pizza with the wrong toppings. This is a phraxos film. Risks and challenges Finishing this project is only a matter of time. Please help us make it sooner than later. Unless we all die, this project will get finished.
