My husband is a very hard worker. During the week he drives a truck and on the weekend he films. Weddings, races, whatever he can. Working in film has always been his dream. I (his wife) am an insurance agent by the way, and I help him with video work on the weekends. He has always wanted to film a movie- and not just any movie- one that he would write, film, and direct. This year he wrote the script for "Devil's Tango". A story of good vs evil. Imagine what would happen in the struggle between Heaven and Hell if an angel and a devil had a child... That is what this story is about. Dennis is incredible talented and wants this movie to be perfect- not a "B" movie. We are lucky to have many wonderful people in our lives that are donating their time to act, help film, work with hair and makeup, and more. We have been funding this all out of our own pocket so far but could use help. We have locations to rent out to film at, still need some props and wardrobe, and although most of the equipment has already been purchased, there are a few items we still need to make this movie perfect. The movie will be submitted to film festivals and the hopes are that it will get distributed. The final push is on- the first day of filming is this coming Saturday. We are hoping to have the movie completed within a year, but it might take a little longer since we only have weekends to film it, and because we don't want to rush it and have the movie turn out less than perfect. Risks and challenges The only obstacles we would run into would be if an issue came up with an actor who couldn't finish the movie- in which case we would have to do a script change or find a new actor. If we are denied filming in a location we would have to look for another location. Some of these things may delay the final product, but it will be finished. It's my husband's dream and we will make it happen no matter what. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
