Goodmorning everyone, I have a brilliant project in mind but do not have the economic means to be able to create without your help! Question: How long is lost on the internet to get the best offer for a product? How many email, how long to write, read, reply to all suppliers? Answer: too! Solution: create a website where users, through pre-built format, enter their requests of any kind (change phone plan, new car, dentist appointment, catering for a wedding ... everything that exists!). Vendors registered, they will receive a notice with the new request, and will respond directly to the customer making him the best offer! Just email, just losing valuable time online, it will all be fast and simple!Then the customer will decide which quote to accept, and in this way, thanks to competition, prices will always be lower and you will have more and more services! A company web projet will create the online platform, I will manage the platform and I will manage the advertising! The beta version for Italy will be online in May 2016, the beta world in November 2016. Thank you all for your attention! Risks and challenges What are the possible risks? It will probably be difficult at first to find companies which intend to register, but with register free for the first year the problem is overcome! Currently I manage two websites, I know how to better publicize the project! And as soon as I reached 50,000 â‚¬ I create an advertisement to be transmitted on TV!
