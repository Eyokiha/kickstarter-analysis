I am going to Hawaii in November and I have always wanted to play the Plantation Course at Kapalua. It is very expensive, and for a golfer who shoots in the 90's consistently, its hard to pull the trigger. Please help me to get to play the course and chronicle the course on a hole by hole basis. Risks and challenges The only issues that could arise is if it rains to the point where they dont allow golfers to play. However, I will be there a week and will make sure to play it if I get funded. Delays in printing of pictures, shouldnt be an issue. Gifts for pro shop items could be affected if the airlines lose my luggage. Other than that, there should be no issues.
