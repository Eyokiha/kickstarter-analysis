L.A. Met Opera Company is using kickstarter as a way to raise funds online for our production of The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart in April. There are many expenses in opera including our sets, costumes, stage crew, house manager, photographer, venue rental, marketing, supertitles, our orchestra, condensed into an intimate live string quartet with keyboard and additional instrumentalists as budget allows, our Director, Assistant Director, and Conductor.L.A. Met's mission is two-fold. We strive to bring quality productions of operatic gems to those who are under-served in our community and to provide accessibility to those who desire the beauty that opera affords. We also seek to be a springboard for emerging artists as they build a career in professional music.Here are videos of our previous productions. Thank you for considering donating to L.A. Met in 2012-13! Risks and challenges Opera has always faced challenged throughout its 400-year history. However, the good will of many patrons have secured our particular company with a successful track record of supporting rising stars as well as providing accessibility to the arts. Any setbacks that may occur would be all within the scope of our specific production. In other words, we have understudies, volunteers and supporters to help us through any obstacles in production. The goal that we have set for this project is modest in relation to the total cost of our actual expenses. Ticket sales will cover many of these expenses but your kickstarter donation will be a boost to our confidence as singers, directors, and artists. Thank you! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
