UrbanArias is a new opera company dedicated to producing short, contemporary operas. Our mantra is OPERA, SHORT, NEW; our mission is to bring engaging, accessible and affordable opera to DC-area audiences and give both emerging and established composers opportunities to present their shorter work, nothing longer than 90 minutes! We hope audiences find both their mundane and extraordinary moments reflected in works we produce. Our first festival of contemporary opera, March 31-April 10 2011, presents three powerful works in repertory at the newly-renovated Artisphere in Arlington: Orpheus and Euridice and Green Sneakers, both by Ricky Ian Gordon and Glory Denied by Tom Cipullo. Your gift will support this fabulous first season, helping us fund the artists who bring these operas to life, and will ensure that contemporary opera becomes a real part of DC's burgeoning arts scene. We intend to begin commissioning works in the 2012 season, and hope to unveil one brand-new short opera each year. UrbanArias, Inc. is a 501 (c)(3) organization; all donations are tax-deductible to the extent allowable by law. OPERA. SHORT. NEW.
