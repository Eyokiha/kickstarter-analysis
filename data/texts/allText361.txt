It has become something we really love and proud. The more we develop, the further this game seems to take us and surprise us.Because we insisted on maintaining the highest quality of art and game play experience during development, two of our team members ( art and coding) decided to quit their jobs and start working full time on this project.Therefore, your support plays a crucial part in backing us financially, which would help us to produce this game at the highest possible standard. Here is how your contribution will be implemented: And with your additional contribution we can go even further! So who are we? Lantern Studio is a small creative team founded in 2015.
