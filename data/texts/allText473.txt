But no one can identify the killer. What's his secret? The lead detective is mystified until clues lead him to uncover how the killer disguises himself. But there's a dark connection between the two that runs deep, brought to a chilling climax when the killer chooses the detective's young daughter as his next victim. Where the Money Goes We are seeking funds to complete the 5-minute pilot episode. We have access to the equipment we need, as well as an excellent team of professionals, but still need $6,500 to cover the remaining production and post-production costs. This includes art sets and props, special effects, craft service (must feed the crew!), permits, editing, sound design, and more. If we exceed our goal, additional funds will go into the 2nd episode of the series. Thank you in advance for your support!
