I am very near completing my best album to date and some of the demo's I have put on certain websites have had in excess of 70,000 downloads. So this classical piano album should do really well. There will be Approx 15 tracks lasting approx 60 mins to 70 mins.Some Tracks have been uploaded to have a listen to above.So far I have composed these listed tracks:The way we areThe Journey EastTender HeartbreakSomething to RememberOriental GardenNow and ForeverMystic WarriorIf I were...Far Away, So CloseEverything ChangesBeing ThereSo that's around 45 minutes approx already completed. I have composed for movies and documentaries, news media and games alike. I sincerely hope you guys can help me by your kind hearted donations. It would be great if it was a million seller and you had your name associated with it. I have about 2 or 3 more songs to complete the album. It was nice when the author of the worlds best selling "How to play piano" DVD sent me an email to say he listened to my music when he relaxes. So please have faith in me and donate, Every one of you will get something special in return. Marky Risks and challenges I work hard everyday to make sure I finish my project. I am 3 or 4 songs away from completing one of the most relaxing and beautiful piano albums ever. Other people have said that , I am not pretentious lol. I will reach my goal in the next 2 months. I have to wait for inspiration but luckily I have it in abundance at the moment. Potential setbacks could be artwork taking longer than usual as I have to pay a designer and artist, or the printing of the CD's which can be a big job and expensive. The actual quote for CD printing, Artwork and Case etc... can be $3.88 per item. I will keep all backers informed as to the progress on nearly a daily basis. I master the recordings myself and could take a little time but most of the compositions I keep as near to my demo's as possible. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
