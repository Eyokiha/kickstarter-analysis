The project I am creating is a full length student film entitled "Scarecrow from Outer Space". I am trying to combine the simple, fun, and some times cheesy feel of a 1950's B-movie with the look of a modern independent film. "Scarecrow from Outer Space" is, as you may have guessed, a film about a scarecrow from outer space crashing in the desert. The film will follow a similar plot structure as the original Sci-Fi/Horror films of the 50's, but the film will be shot in color and take place in present day. This film will bring that nostalgic feel to those who grew up watching these films on TV in 1960's and still have the ability to gain the attention of a new generation. The film will be shot by film students at Arizona State University.
