Presque Isle River Falls The PresentHello! Thanks for checking out my Kickstarter project. My name is Scott and I discovered a love for nature photography in the fall of 2014. That was the first time I'd been to Minnesota's North Shore and really got to experience the power and beauty of Lake Superior. I've been lucky enough to capture more images from Wisconsin and Upper Michigan and thought this would be a great way to share my vision with the world.The postcards meet the requirements of the U.S. Postal Service and would be great to send to kids at camp, gift to friends and family, or just frame them and put your favorites up in your home or office. You'll get 10 of my best Lake Superior images printed on sturdy 18 point cardstock. The photo side will have a UV finish to protect the image from fading. The back is uncoated and perfect for writing notes with your instrument of choice. The set will be hand packaged in a Crystal Clear Hanging Bag to view the top postcard clearly. These will look great packaged and are perfectly suited for gift-giving. Bond Falls The FutureIf this Kickstarter is successful, I plan to keep the momentum going and release a postcard set on Kickstarter for each of the five Great Lakes. This would be a wonderful opportunity for me to travel and collect some beautiful images from the shores of these great bodies of water. Please consider supporting my dream and purchase a few sets today! Gooseberry Falls State Park Split Rock Lighthouse Bonanza Falls Grand Marais Light Sugarloaf Cove Risks and challenges Most of the images for the postcards are processed and ready to sent to the printer. If this project is funded, I'll be able to print, assemble, package and send the post card packs within 3 weeks. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
