THANKS FOR STOPPING IN...Hi Folks, it's Mike Aiken here and I can't wait to tell you how excited we are about my new CD, CAPTAINS & COWBOYS! I believe it to be the best I've done! Best writing, best playing, best produced. I've spent 2 years writing the tunes and a lifetime living the experiences to do so. When completed it will be a full length CD with at least one music video. Recorded at Sound Emporium in Nashville with some of Music City's best musicians. Add to that producers Dan Baird (Georgia Satellites) and Ben Strano bringing their talents and kicking my butt to get the best out of me... and it's gonna be awesome! HERE WE GO... LISTEN UP to a few samples while you read. This is an unmastered sneak preview of what we've been working on. TO DATE...WHEW, WE'VE BEEN BUSY!2012 marks 10 years since my first indie CD Travelin Bone was released. In that time Amy and I have released 5 CDs with 8 songs hitting the charts from the Top 30 to # 1 in the US and Europe. My songs have been included in various compilations and one of my tunes was selected in the Top 40 sports songs of all time by Sports Illustrated. We've played coast to coast and in between including 3 tours in Europe. And oh yeah... I started a not-for-profit music festival along the way that supports youth music education (Aiken & Friends Fest, Smithfield, VA). Being independent musicians we've funded everything ourselves. We do not have the support or financial backing of a major label to help get the music to the masses. We've been self-funded solely out of our own pockets, leveraging each dollar to go as far as we could make it go. Of course, we couldn't have done this without your support in buying tickets, CDs, downloads and letting us crash in your houses and boats etc. For that we are VERY GRATEFUL.It's all been a great ride and once again this train is picking up speed as we try to finish up my 6th CD, CAPTAINS & COWBOYS, but now I need to ask you to join the ride and climb on board. SO HERE'S THE DEAL all you captains and cowboys... I'm coming to you to gather funds so that we have the capital to put this record out with a BONE IN HER TEETH and a YIPPY KYE YIY YAY!! I think Kickstarter and other crowdfunding platforms like this are the BEST way to put out music right now - no rules, no fuss, no muss, (no wasted money on corporate lunches) - just US and the music. WHICH MEANS... With our frugal (some say cheap) sailors approach combined with an Indie musicians mentality we will leverage this project to match what a major label would spend $250,000 to do. We've proven this over the last 10 years. Every penny will be stretched to the max. (WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR FREE MONEY... keep reading... see the REWARDS to the right --->) This record is more than we've ever tried to undertake before, and will be followed with a U.S. and European tour. Every dollar will go towards paying for the production of the CD, ARTWORK, filming the VIDEO, manufacturing the CDs for U.S. and European release (which means a LOT of CDs), distribution, PR and social media MARKETING, RADIO promotion, and STUDIO production. KICKSTARTER IS AN ALL OR NOTHING FUNDING CAMPAIGN, if we don't reach our goal ALL your money will be returned. IF we exceed our goal (and I hope we do) all extra funds will be used for additional marketing and promotion. None of these dollars go in my pocket. To all our friends and fans who have become a part of our MIKE AIKEN MUSIC FAMILY and who continue to show us your support and love...we THANK YOU!For those of you who know me off stage you know that I'm a self reliant, independent type of person and that I don't like asking anyone for anything and it makes me uncomfortable to do so... so we've come up with some very cool REWARDS designed with you in mind.
