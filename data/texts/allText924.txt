An orphanage is a residential institution devoted to the care of orphans – children whose biological parents are deceased or otherwise unable or unwilling to take care of them. Biological parents, and sometimes biological grandparents, are legally responsible for supporting children, but in the absence of these or other relatives willing to care for the children, they become a ward of the state, and orphanages are one way of providing for their care, housing and education.It's no secret that any society faces the problem of orphanhood. Often the staff of orphanages and shelters is unable to provide full development of their pupils. But there have always been people willing to help orphans, to give joy and love to children with sad lifestories. Do not be indifferent to the suffering of others! Share your kindness with those who really need it.Worldwide, SOS Children’s Villages operates over 500 Villages in 133 countries where we raise over 80,000 children. Through our many education, family strengthening, medical, and community outreach programs, SOS impacts the lives of over 1 million people every year. • It is estimated that 153 million children worldwide, ranging from infants to teenagers, have lost one or both parents (UNICEF). • Over 7 million children are in institutional care worldwide (Save). Screenshot of demo-site We propose to create a web service where anyone can quickly and easily share their kindness with a child. The kids’ paintings would comprise a gallery where you can buy any of the pictures, choosing a present to the kid as a matter of payment. Delivery of gifts and drawings would be conducted by the project participants. Picture would be delivered to your address. This is a way for you to become a patron of children's art. It’s easy, it’s accessible and it’s generous! Risks and challenges The main risk is a delivery risk. So we will use only official transport and post companies.
