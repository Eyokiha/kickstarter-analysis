The Young Pickers is a performance group of kids who love music and want to learn the skills that come with being a working, professional musician. We range in age from 7-16 and we are bound and determined to record our very own album! This will entail music arranging, careful rehearsing and a lot of performing to make sure we are ready to go into the studio! In addition, the album art will be designed by the Young Pickers and the details of recording and ordering CD's will be shared with the kids. We will then have the beginning of some swag for our merchandise table which will really allow us to practice the business skills that working musicians have to develop in order to be self-supporting. The Young Pickers are directed by Annie Savage and Andrea Love. They are generously accompanied by Kevin Slick and Janeen Bogue and sponsored by the Colorado Bluegrass Music Society. For more information on how to join in on the fun, go to www.coloradobluegrass.org. Risks and challenges Our ensemble is made up of 100% kids, so we have the challenge of making sure as many of us can be at one place at the same time! With busy schedules, it can be interesting for us to all get together in one place. We hope to release the album in August at our biggest show of the year, the NedFest festival in our favorite little mountain town, Nederland, Colorado! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
