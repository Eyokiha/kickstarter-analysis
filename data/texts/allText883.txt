The project is a means to a calm relationship when arguments get a little heated, whether its parents and teenagers or families and friends the whole focus is to prevent those explosive and most times unwarranted comments that wreck relationships out of frustration not out of spite. If we save one family or friendship due to the fact those words were never said then the time, $$$ and effort will be worth is.Just want to highlight that this app is designed for parents and teenagers that have a lot of conflict and can't communicate face to face with out yelling or worse violence. Costing’s: We have allowed $15 to 20k for the apps development the rest will be spent on patents, legal and marketing. We feel the app will change people’s lives and we are trying to deliver this for free to both ios and android. May be a few in app purchases but the core focus on this app will be free. Risks and challenges The key to making The Communicator a success is easy. YOU! We have researched parents and teenagers and they all agree that this would take the edge off conflict and resolve issue before blowing up and the unforgiving happens and the respect or friendship ends. We have also talked to family and friend members that have role played the app and feel that there is a need for this. We have plans in place to get this app out as quick as possible.
