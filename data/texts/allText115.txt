I started to take pictures for over a year now and I'm located in the Bay Area,CA. I joined a group of artists and we're all doing our thing as well as contributing into it by creating art and bringing people to showcase their art. The reason for this project is because i always admired the pictures in canvas and i thought well why can't i do it? I would want to make this happen because its something that can capture many peoples attention due to the fact that they could have something local or something outstanding on their wall by me! Risks and challenges For those who back me up I will try to send you what i promised as long as I meet my goal! Yes theres going to be some setbacks but don't worry i will get to you because you're helping me grow and id would definitely like to meet those who have helped me! If anything bad happens dont worry i will do anything in my hands in order to keep this project going and get you some amazing pictures! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
