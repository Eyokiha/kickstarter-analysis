Have you ever seen a photo somewhere of an amazing landscape and said wow I want to go there? Little do alot of people know that we have alot of those beauties hidden in the United States. I am an aspiring freelance photographer on a mision to share our landscapes from views never seen before. My Goal: To be able to open a website with free to use and download landscapes from around the United States. To be able to share these landscapes with people that will never be able to go to them. After the website becomes successfull, our next aim is to create a hardback book with the top areas in America. Help me support our landscapes and share the beauty of this country with all! Risks and challenges The Biggest risk of this is not being funded. The funds will be used to create our website and purchase photo editing software to be able to customize our pictures to our customers needs. Join me in sharing a passion for our landscapes around the world! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
