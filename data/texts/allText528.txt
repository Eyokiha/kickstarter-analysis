We are going to be using this funding for essiental things like renting gear, housing, transporting and feeding cast and crew. We will also be using it to buy props, wardrobe and paying a composer for the final score of the film. We are going to work our hardest to make sure whatever help we get is going to be used to the fullest. Risks and challenges We have learned a few things making films and one of the most important lesson we have learned is things will go wrong and they always will. The best thing we can do as a team and a crew is to make sure we are always prepared for the worst and always be able to think on our feet. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
