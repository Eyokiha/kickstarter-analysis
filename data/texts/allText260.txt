I am an award winning composer who is passionate and dedicated to creating new classical music that is both well crafted and enjoyable to listen to. In recent years funding has dried up from many of the arts funding sources that existed. I've decided to use Kickstarter to try to raise funds for this composition project. This will also allow me to be more hands on in raising funds and offer a window for us to partner in the creative process. What do you get in return for helping me compose a new string quartet ? Aside for the satisfaction of helping out a worthy cause, you can choose from any of the items listed on the right hand side of the page. My goal is to raise $1,500 by Sept 23, 2010. Please consider a donation to this commission. If I can reach my goal by the deadline, my project will be funded and you will receive the rewards you have selected. If I fail to reach my goal, however, I will get nothing, you will not be charged, and no rewards can be sent. I accept that any donation would carry with it a great responsibility to uphold the highest work ethics and standards. My strongest, most successful work has been produced in settings demanding excellence and I have always thrived creatively within them. If new music is not being created by living composers of today, in the future there will be no past.
