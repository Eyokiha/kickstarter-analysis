With the launch of the New Third Roman Missal there is a large gap in service music to meet the needs of average and not so average music programs in parishes of all sizes. While there was a rush to publish a large number of new settings of the proper Mass texts, very few of them are musically worthwhile and many very difficult to sing.Additionally there is a depth of richness to the chant texts for the Propers for each day of the year which have no musical setting.This project seeks to provide easy to sing chant melodies and choral settings for use in the average parish choir, with augmentations for more developed musical settings. This will be music that is easy to sing and learn, yet has artistic integrity that will last beyond the latest musical fad. Think concert quality choral music that can be used at every Mass, that augments and does not distract from the liturgical action. This is a complete setting of EVERY antiphon that is meant to be sung within the Missal. We want this to be a go to source for hard to find texts and provide a useable option at minimal cost.Ive been encouraged to begin this work by several Priests for whom I have written psalm and mass text settings. It is also rooted in my own experience as a liturgical choral director and director of liturgy. To my knowledge this would be the first such complete work of its kind for the English speaking Church. At the conclusion of the project, Parishes and individuals will be able to purchase the complete work or sections of it, at cost so that even the smallest of parish can have a major resource in the music library.
