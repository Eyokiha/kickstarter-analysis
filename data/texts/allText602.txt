WHY VENTBIG.COM WAS CREATED:Like most entrepreneurial ideas, author, novelist, publishers, and entrepreneur David L. Brown, became frustrated with a product or service. Back in early January, 2014, he became increasingly frustrated due to being restricted to only 140 characters on Twitter when he tweeted and posted photos. David soon noticed that 140 characters were dramatically reduced when he posted a photo or hashtag, leaving him with limited opportunity to fully express himself beyond short, one line tweets! Depending upon the size of the photo he wanted to post (standard photo size is 600X400), in addition to text, out of 140 characters allowed on Twitter, he often found himself left with only a handful of characters to use because the size of the photo, even a small sized photo, ate the majority of Twitter's 140 text characters!! David also became frustrated numerous times with having to go back and edit his tweets to fit within the parameters of 140 Twitter characters after going over the limit, causing him to leave out content that he felt was important. David strongly believes that sometimes when you have more to say, you need more than 140 characters to fully express yourself. Thus, VENTBIG.COM was born!

That's what we at VentBig.com would also like to know. THIS IS OUR CHALLENGE. You see, I'm a huge advocate for increasing the numbers of females in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) industry. I have a soon-to-be 18 year-old daughter who loves the sciences and technology. I always encourage her to enthusiastically pursue her goals. The most common misconception is that people assume you have to master all four areas of STEM to be successful. That’s simply not the case. What you do have to do is be enthusiastic about learning and growing as your career evolves. That's why VentBig.com is in SEARCH for female coders, app developers and designers, and computer engineers to assist us in building out the infrastructure for VentBig.com app. We will also consider multiple female engineers as potential co-founders of VentBig.com app! So what are you waiting for, let's get busy and build the next greatest app! ~ David L. Brown, Founder and CEO, VentBig.com Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
