Grit: Our Debut Album For the past year, we’ve been hard at work writing and shaping the music for our debut album featuring Robbin Kapsalis (lead vocals) and Bill Holter (guitars) Alex Kuldell (drums) and Mark Chandler (bass). This self-produced album will include three blues covers and eight original songs written by Robbin Kapsalis and Mark Chandler; with all music arranged and performed by Vintage#18. Opening the show for The Nighthawks! It’s been a long road, and during our three years together, we’ve honed a sound uniquely Vintage#18, and wanted to capture and share that energy with the world. Making an album is more than just recording and selling it; making an album requires patience, perseverance and dedication. We’re a tight-knit group and sharing this album means a lot to all of us both personally and professionally.
