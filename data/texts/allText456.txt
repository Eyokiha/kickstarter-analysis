Planning on opening a Bar and Grill focusing on spicy food and drinks. I also plan on having Ice cold beer and homemade Ice Cream and live music and local art. Simple but creative food and drinks in a dark and scary atmosphere. Very Tongue in Cheek and fun! Risks and challenges Denver has many great bar and restaurants and there is alot of competition. I have over 30 years experience and will have to offer a unique and quality product and a fair and reasonable price. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
