We released a 5 track EP entitled "Further Down The Line" in June of 2013. When we recorded that EP, we had written 10 original songs but only had funds to record 5. Since then, we've been writing, writing, writing and now have over 20 original songs. Our set time has ballooned from 45 minutes to 90 minutes of original music, but we only have a 5 track EP to show for it. We desperately need your help to record a new, full length CD for release in June 2014. The songs are written, the CD has been named "Songs About Her," the studio time has been reserved and the musicians are ready to recordâ€¦.all we need is YOUR HELP to raise the funds necessary to record this new CD. We humbly ask for your contribution to make this project a reality and help push Costello a little "Further Down The Line!" Risks and challenges We feel that the challenges of this project are minimal. When recording any CD, you are limited in the number of hours you can use the recording studio based on your budget. This means that you must be prepared to work long hours to get the project completed within the time frame you paid to use the studio. We are committed to working around the clock if necessary to complete this album on time and within budget. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
