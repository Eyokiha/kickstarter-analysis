Why use BubblePhoneCase™? Hackers have so many different ways to access your phone camera these days. While the direct hacking option remains popular, some enterprising hackers have even switched to hacking by app. Next time you install an app whose origin is unknown, consider that you might be giving someone you don’t know permission to access your camera. While there are antivirus programs that try to solve this problem, the only way to guarantee your privacy is by putting a cover in front of your camera. After all, antivirus programs are themselves vulnerable to being hacked by attackers. In today’s world, politicians and celebrities go to great lengths to avoid getting their phones hacked. So why not do the same? Don’t allow hackers to violate your privacy! Rewards: The campaign rewards is essential for us.
