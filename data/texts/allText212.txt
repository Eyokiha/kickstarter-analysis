I've waited a long time to make a full length, full band album, and I can't wait any longer! I've got a great group of original songs that illustrate a life that is constantly changing but growing in the midst of that change. I'm ready to get these out so all of you can hear them. I'm proud of my musical growth since the last time I went in studio.I'm raising funds to cover the cost of the recording process. I'll be heading down to Austin to Cedar Creek Recording to work with some of my favorite and most talented friends. I'm giddy about the musicians who are interested in being a part of this -- they're the best at what they do, and I'm so thankful they like me enough to want to come in studio with me! I appreciate you taking the time to check out my project. I'm grateful for any kind of support you offer, whether it be monetarily (which will ensure this album will happen), through words of encouragement, or your social marketing prowess! Spread the word! I have never wanted anything so badly in my life, and I promise I will put every ounce of my heart and soul into this. I'm a hard worker -- it's all I know.Thank you!
