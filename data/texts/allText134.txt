I am a multi instrument musician who is dedicated to tapping in to the magical powers of music. Im not the best musician in the world, but what i lack in skill I make up in the ability to lock into the groove. Since my wife passed a couple of years ago, I have a yearning to start making music. It seems everytime I try to buy tools for recording, something comes up. I need help in creating a home studio so I can record an album..Id like my legacy to include making awesome music and being a good father to my six adpoted children ( my deceased wife's and her ex husband) My musical styles are electronic/ Jam/ experimental/ funk/ stoner metal/ pyschedelic/ avant garde, etc. I really wish to make my dreams come true. I hope with your help I'll be able to. Risks and challenges Getting overwhelmed with possibilty of ideas. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
