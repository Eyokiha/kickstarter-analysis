I have always been driven to help others and my goal is simple. I want to develop an app that allows users to donate no more, and no less than $1 to a cause of their choice. We will work tirelessly to make sure we connect those willing to give with those in need. What will $1 do you say? Ask the same question if we manage to get even even 0.1% of the 2 billion global smartphone users projected by 2016. That's 2 million users with the reach to instantaneously raise $2 million for a common cause. What happens if we reach 1% of that market, even 10%? There is power in numbers and its human nature to want to coalesce around a common cause. Let's test the concept with this kickstarter, and create a community that changes the world.

Once we raise the target amount, our goal will be to mitigate any challenges that come our way. Key success factors are: - Building the right team, rooted in community and technology - Building relationships with organizations that need fundraising - Developing an intuitive platform to showcase causes Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
