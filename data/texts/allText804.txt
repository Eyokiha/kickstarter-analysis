Language Nanny - Learn languages before you even walkWhat is it?Language learning is hard. We always thought about how we can overcome the language barriers we currently face in this world. Now finally we had this simple but yet perfect idea. Why don't we just raise our kids bilingual or even multilingual. Now how do you go about doing that? You have to have a foreign wife or husband right? Not really. We came up with a perfect way to raise your kids bilingual.We want to make a website for you to connect to foreign nannies. Those can then raise your children in your preferred language. You get to choose the language the price and can even look at the qualifications of the nanny. The nannies in return can list their expected wage and their qualifications on the site. Think of it as freelance for nannies with language knowledge. What do we need your donations for?We are trying to establish a website to connect you and the foreign nannies. Because programmers are expensive we need your help to fund this project. Risks and challenges The hard part is going to win big amount of users over and get them to use the site. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
