I love capturing the magic and spirit of New Orleans with my camera lens. I also love gumbo too, but since I can't sell that, this Kickstarter campaign is all about my canvas prints. Living in New York, I am constantly homesick for the food (and drinks!), music, history and culture New Orleans has to offer. I created my Etsy shop, Mama Roux's as a means to fill the void in my heart.My canvases offer a taste of food, a tour of the city, a trip to the bayou and a cheer for the Saints (I added a a touch of good mojo to those). To check out my canvases etsy.com/shop/mamarouxs I'm raising funds to keep this hobby flourishing and to one day get a mama back to New Orleans! Risks and challenges whatever challenges come up, I'll keep you updated of all the progress in getting the product to you. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
