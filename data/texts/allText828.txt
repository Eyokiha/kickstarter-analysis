Enuvision is a new initiative to combine online shopping with Virtual Reality Experience. If you're like us, who constantly go online to find new technology or some great deals, Enuvision will not only allow you to do that, but also let you feel the experience of real life shopping. We are planning to design Enuvision as a 3D and Web Based shopping mall where users use their VR Headsets to go into the mall to find their favorite online retailers and purchase their desired goods. 3D Models of most items in any stores will be used as "Display" piece along with the related description. This lets customer see the item in every view using their VR Gear's controller.
