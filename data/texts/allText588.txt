As a truck driver, we have a lot of responsibility to uphold. Some of those responsibilities are to the general public and ourselves. Members of the trucking community understand the importance of getting a proper education on driving trucks of all sizes. Truckerconnections.com will be the place for where new drivers are able to read up on CDL school reviews and see a star rating given by students that have attendend the school. Along with a few affiliates and employers, we have a large database that will keep drivers working. With this new website, employers will get a better insight on the kind of drivers they place behind the wheel. Risks and challenges It hasn't been easy completing this project on my own. Getting the public to trust this website and its ability to resolve the two main problems that the trucking industry faces will be the challenge. This website focuses on the first problem which is the shortage of quality drivers behind the wheel. Right now we have a demand for 80,000 CDL truck drivers, and this number will continue to grow. By combining every resource we have on the internet for truck driving under one website, new drivers will have a better chance of getting the education they need and the career of there choice.
