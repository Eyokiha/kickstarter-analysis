This story is very pertinent for people of my generation because there's a sense amongst the youth of not knowing their place in the world and that's its biggest theme. We are shooting with a very talented Director of Photography, John Hudak. The guy knows his stuff. The lead actor, co-writer,co-producer Rory Dunwoody is a very talented performer: http://www.rorydunwoody.com/rory-dunwoody-4 And one of the coolest things about this movie is that we have some names attached to it in the supporting cast: Matt McCarthy http://www.youtube.com/watch... Paul Sevigny http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/fashion/08close.html We are going to shoot this movie during six days in mid-January. We need a minimum of 6500,00, that would be a bare bones budget, just enough to shoot with very little leeway, and we would shoot with the Canon 7d. Ideally I would like to have at least 10k because with that we can explore the possibility of getting a RED rental-- for the ones that don't know cameras, the RED is one of the best digital cameras you can get there and it averages on 1k rental per weekend through professional rental places though we would look for a cheaper private owned to rent from which would be cheaper. Plus having some extra breathing space for the production, and then being able to have a more pleasurable experience for everyone because we know we would not being running on fumes. This is a project I truly believe in and that I think can go the long haul with all the talents in it. Thanks so much for being a part of this.
