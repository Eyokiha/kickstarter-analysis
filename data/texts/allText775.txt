So... Here is the planThe best ideas are always the simplest, I want to make this as simple as can be for singles people looking to meet other single people. There will be a map view and also a list view of live single events going on around the city for the week. The maps will show the location of each of the events. You can also click and buy tickets for events on the app.Here is a step by step process of how I will achieve the goal of building the app and also marketing the app.Step 1 - Build the AppBuilding the app interface will cost around £11,000-£14,000, This will take around 4 Months to build and complete the app.Step 2 -MarketingWith my knowledge of the industry I have the perfect way to market the app by involving every company that runs any type of single event, we will charge a fee to companies to post their events and use marketing tools to attract single people to download the app such as 20% off first ticket.Funding will be used to create the app and marketing activity to singles. Risks and challenges In terms or risks, single dating companies may choose not to pay for the service. This may be an issue however using the model of meetup companies will pay a once off member fee and then a fee for every ticket sold. With over 3 years in the dating industry and running my own dating company i believe the challenges that lie ahead can be solved by the experience within this sector.
