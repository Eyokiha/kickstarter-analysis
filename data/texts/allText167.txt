After 8 years of working on remixes for some fantastic up and coming artists, as well as some established ones http://soundcloud.com/chrisjaymusicproductions/sets/official-remixes/, and writing a few demos and tracks with some amazing songwriters from all over the world http://soundcloud.com/chrisjaymusicproductions/sets/productions-demos/, I'm finally ready to release my first EP of original songs. To get an idea of the kind of music to expect from these, please check out my video!The funds raised from this Kickstarter project will cover the costs for finishing off the recordings, mastering (by Bj√∂rn Engelmann at Cutting Room, Sweden), packaging design (by my dear friend Liam Curry) and CD manufacturing. I admit that I'm setting my bar extremely high, but who got anywhere by aiming low? Risks and challenges The challenges I'm likely to face after the project is funded are delays with the manufacturing of the CDs - I will certainly keep everyone up-to-date with what's happening. I'm confident that the recording and mastering will be completed on schedule. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
