Pakistan Reports is the first key towards the reporting chain and we want people to work for the betterment of a society. We allow people to post about the illegal, harmful and unwanted things around them and share them on social media. But wait, you do not want to show your identity as you may report your neighbor who is stealing electricity or is involved in some suspicious act, we promise to keep your identity hidden from others unless if you do not want that.Its time to improve our society for our upcoming generations and make sure things are made better by reporting things that responsible authorities ignore. We are starting the chain from Pakistan and we plan to move on to other countries. This mission for a good cause should not be stopped and for that we need your support. We are here on Kickstarter so that you can help us in growing our network.Back us now for your a bring future !!! Risks and challenges The only challenge to us is to verify how authentic reports are and for that we are designing the application in a way that people are bound to post images and video`s along with their posts. To deal with this challenge, we are also planning to open small centers in difference cities across different countries to authenticate reports that are being reported by the people. Later in future we plan to allow other users to authenticate reports posted by the users meaning that they can claim if the news is fake or real by posting content against the existing report. Its time when people have to bring change and spread the word. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
