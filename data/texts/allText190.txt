I am so excited to make this record! I have been dreaming of my debut album for as long as I can remember. Then a few years ago, I picked up a ukulele and discovered that I had finally found the sound I’d been searching for… that magical music behind the songs I’d been hearing in my head. I’ve been writing constantly and I’m at a point where I’ve created a great group of original songs that I would love to release. I’m ready to get into the studio & look forward to sharing this music with you fully produced and realized. I’m here raising funds to cover the cost of the recording process. I’ve got to pay for studio time, musicians, mixing & mastering. In order to do this I need to raise a minimum of $6000. With that I believe I can create a truly beautiful product. Anything I raise beyond that amount will just go to make the album all the more layered & delicious because I will be gifted with more studio time & money to pay additional collaborators (strings would be oh so dreamy). I’ll also be able to invest in promoting the finished product. I am a total music junkie and ever since I was a little girl I have loved to sing. I love art that can engage, entertain & inspire.
