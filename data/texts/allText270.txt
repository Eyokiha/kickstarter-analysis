This is a CD with three of the greatest masterpieces ever written for violin and piano, all between the years of 1875 and 1896. The project is actually already completed, however, as the project turned out to be more pricy than we had thought, we are in need of extra funds to pay our editor. Our previous CD was selected at the 'CD of the month' by Strad Magazine, perhaps the most prestigious string magazine in the world. It also received glowing reviews in the American Record Guide and in String Magazine. We are hoping for no less with this CD! Costs involved in this project included publication, duplication, recording, editing, mastering and processing. Risks and challenges There were two major setbacks with this project. One being that it took much longer to edit than we had thought, the second that the final price was quite a bit higher than we had budgeted. The good news, however, is that the CD is done. The Master CD has been submitted and the graphic design is complete. We are simply in need of funds to pay the final bills so that the CD can be released! Thank you so much for considering helping us! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
