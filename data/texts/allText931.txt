(Download Entire Business Guide http://searedwax.com/404Persons_BusinessGuide.pdf)Mission Statement The 404Persons application is a non-profit notification system designed to replace or enhance all standard Internet missing 404 page errors abroad by supplanting a simple, clean, easy-to-use and powerful alert notification insert visibly informing the target viewer with local "Amber Alerts" and other missing persons in the area. By utilizing an otherwise unused and commonly reached destination, this noninvasive approach to helping find, rescue, and repair families not only seeks to raise awareness—but inspire mankind to think outside-the-box and utilize abstract problem-solving to achieve social justice & restore our spirit. Frequently our lives are rich with unseized opportunities to greatly make even the simplest of differences that fall unnoticed by brilliant, creative thinkers and innovators due to the hectic war zone of obligations and crowded-schedules. 404Persons was inspired by a dream that we believe sheds light on ways that we as a species may come together and improve our effectiveness as a worldwide brotherhood. By donating even a single portion to supporting the 404Persons cause, you contribute to shifting our consciousness from one of busy, over-packed consumerism & obsession with celebrities to a powerful force of virtue, connectedness, peace, fairness, & equality; we know that every life on this planet matters—and it's vital to think outside-the-box when it comes to restoring earthly harmony. It isn't enough to merely excel in life—this is a pivotal technological era that holds the key to joining forces in learning to make exceptional, thorough use of our precious time, space, attention & resources to donate the smallest of digital real-estate toward a selfless philanthropic endeavor of saving lives; we oblige each other to remember this strategy not only as an ideal—but as a sub-par standard—never fully satisfied, but content and motivated until an equilibrium is reached. We are extremely gracious to all who believe in our cause for creating a better society, and it is with tremendous heartfelt joy that we desire to thank each and every last one of our supporters—knowing that you are not only impacting the lives of some unfortunate souls who went missing—but contributing to the transformation of the heaviest of grievances within each and every single person to whom they’ve touched, while helping to shield future victims—including your loves ones & yourself. While 404Persons cannot undo damage that has already been done, or guarantee anyone will be found—it is at a minimum always our standup civilian duty to try our best to create & sustain hope, discourage & eliminate crime, and to walk & live by faith—understanding fully that even one missing person is wholly too much, and when one goes missing—their legacy continues on inside each of us. This is one cause certain to make a difference in the lives of everyone. QualificationsSealed Wax (http://searedwax.com/) is a digital marketing agency with over 15 years experience in interactive, creative, & social experiments as well as highly advanced and professional complete software. Many of our clients range from travel bureau chambers & entertainment & amusement to corporate business types, housing development & construction, to scientific tools & mediums, fashion e-commerce engines, as well as online gaming; our work has appeared all across the board including award winning cutting-edge applications, expansive boundary-pushing & ground-breaking cross-mobile experiences ushering the initial launch of the iPad, 3-dimensional programming & design, advanced gaming physics integrated into JavaScript & CSS, photography & gorgeous retouching plus manipulation, Google Maps integration monitoring the migrational observation of endangered species, and much more.It is our duty to utilize complex, often abstract creative thinking to analyze very real-world objective problems and to deliver advanced professional quality solutions that solve these challenges in a robust, expansive, yet clean & simplistic ways which appeal to the everyday consumer. ApplicationThe default application will display two missing persons so as to catch the eye but not overwhelm; a link back to 404Persons would directly connect visitors with the ability to submit information to local authorities for each specific case; information such as the missing person’s name, age, and last known location, a photo, and possible age-progression image would be included.The tool is an act of charity intended to help solve crime and save lives, and therefore is, by nature, both inherently free and encouraged to be used; 404Persons is an online service, and not a physical good, and therefore we do not offer this service or sell it as a product except for accepting donations or selling advanced options under the “Premium Service” which would provide webmasters merely with extra tools for philanthropic and amusement purposes.The “Premium Service” is an upgrade from the typical default, free option, and does not increase the chances of finding a missing person; the “Premium Service” is accepted of a charitable donation option and offers statistics in the realm of success click-through rates, missing persons “information reported” statistics via the webmaster’s click-through website, success stories through the webmaster’s portal & 404Persons traffic. Prototype DevelopmentThe development of the application will be built using PHP interfacing with an extensive MySQL database of actively updated missing persons; additional extensive databases for wanted criminals and crime watch will be imported in the future. A clean, sleek user interface for the app will be designed to fit a plethora of purposes; first, the missing persons should stand out to catch the attention of the visitors; second, by eliminating excessive color or décor and other candid mistakes when it comes to design—we understand that the content must speak for itself with respect to the existing GUI so as to beautifully and fluidly suit websites across the spectrum & appeal to our largest audience.Making use of modern CSS styles as well as JavaScript—simple animations in the future could, after testing & tried-to-be-true—implement to enhance the effectiveness of our message.An iFrame would be developed to simplify portability across platforms while a more commonly ported module would also be available for use on websites to those who wish to make use of missing persons reports for other aspects of their web experience outside of the missing pages. It is not, however, our intention to create judgment or unrealistic, dogmatic expectations of others; we believe that a 404 missing persons report is sufficient, and do not recommend the average designer to implement our application outside of this page although it is perfectly acceptable.Our database will require constant maintenance and updates as well as an extremely reliable, powerful server to reach our projected audience at a global level. The application itself would require initial development to jumpstart the journey and further maintenance would be required to keep the application up-to-date, more efficient, and suitable to the growing demands of our consumer base.We will need an extensive, but simple website to house the application and act as a portal for developers to accomplish their needs.Additionally, we will need our application to integrate with varying third-party resources and tools to find and locate the geographic location of the viewer in order to serve up the most relevant results in their area.All missing persons results are randomized, except in the event of immediate Amber Alerts in which case certain results will be prioritized.A vBulletin forum will be purchased and utilized to create a community of awareness, sharing of stories, photos, and prayers along with messages of hope, sightings, questions, and valuable information.Cost Overview Design - $10,000 Development - $20,000 Server - $10,000 Database - $10,000 Maintenance - $20,000 (1 year) Expansion - $30,000 (1 year) Projected Startup Cost: $100,000Greater Success (extraneous) Development - $30,000 Server - $30,000 Database - $50,000 Maintenance - $40,000 Expansion - $250,000 Projected Extraneous Cost: $400,000Long-term GoalsOur long-term goals are to reach internationally abroad for missing person's databases; we hope to expand our design and delivery purpose in a multi-faceted route including a wider array of themes for expansive GUI-type integration, to reach a wider audience by situating 404Persons as the default 404 error page across major hosting companies, corporate websites and an increase in individual usage. By raising awareness we also hope for 404Persons to become a major household name, and therefore its effectiveness to be spread by word of mouth—rivaling and exceeding the success of the milk carton.Expansive efforts & techniques to deliver 404Persons through avenues such as mobile apps & an extensive, broader scope of mediums are possible while we are open to expansion beyond the latter horizon following startup. Risks and challenges Challenges involve putting together an extensive database, which will be accomplished utilizing existing public records, meeting with local officials and joining forces with larger organizations to cohesively bind what would be a thorough and refined central housing of missing persons. Additional existing crime applications and RSS feeds will be scoured and stored in our database, updated nightly via a cron job. Further challenges include spreading our message nationally and streamlining the process, which requires extensive communication and efforts on behalf of our team as well business & travel expenses; larger relevant sites will be researched and targeted via Internet search-engines then prioritized, organized & appealed to upgrade/take-advantage of our unique application. Long-term financing/funding will be required to sustain the project's enduring cost of maintenance and will appeal to the undivided interest of external sponsors for donations. Our organization will continue to request funding whenever necessary to expedite this process at the commencement of each year & to elongate/eternalize the continuing success of its longevity. Technological changes, cross-platform compatibility and sizing issues require continual feedback from our 404Persons fan base and community, while evolutions in development will be created to expand project availability & delivery. International & multilingual efforts & features will remain an immediate outstanding element to the progression of 404Persons’ effectiveness and expansion. We will need to expand our server’s location as well as license and/or travel abroad to develop this enhancement in order to achieve our strong message of hope & safety across borders.
