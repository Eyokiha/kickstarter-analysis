As I've begun to travel, I've realized how difficult it is sometimes to search for things to do in a new place outside of the typical 'tourist' attractions. What is LifeIn this location really like?What is the most popular happy hour for a young professional on a Wednesday afternoon in this location? Where might a family spend a nice Saturday afternoon? When is it easiest to get a tee time for a retired couple? Where can I play recreational volleyball at an open gym?We can learn a lot about the people in a city by their typical and favorite activities. This app will compile rich, valuable data in a simple to use (and easily integrated to FB) format so that it is easy to find truly what a location is like and what there is to do before travelling or moving there.Rather than trying to google this information or try to parse Yelp or another rating app for it, we seek to create a central repository for the data associated with what happens in cities/towns worldwide. It will include where people like to eat, drink, bowl, read, hike, play sports, workout, relax, walk dog, etc. LifeIn will provide the most detailed, anonymous data about a place out there so people thinking of visiting or moving there will have the best understanding of what LifeIn that location is truly like. Risks and challenges Risk obviously exists in the success of an app based on preference or desire. I truly believe that there is a great opportunity here if the app is built correctly. I have a great, experienced team of developers ready to build this app once funding is present. The struggles I foresee are easy integration with current social media platforms so that the DB grows exponentially and the balance between an easy-to-use interface and the complexity of the data desired.
