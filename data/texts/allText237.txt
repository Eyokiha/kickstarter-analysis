Hi Everyone!!! The guys and I are getting ready to begin production on my VERY FIRST full length record. I am SO excited about the project, and cant wait to share with you what we have been working on!!! We will be doing some of the project here in Vancouver, and the rest will be recorded and completed in Nashville, TN. Thank you so much for your continued support!!! I LOVE YOU ALL! Risks and challenges Our challenges for this project include: Having enough studio time to submit a project that we are truly happy with Making music that people will love Its possible that it will take much longer than we anticipate, and we will have to push the release date out We may have to re record and re do some pieces to ensure its what we are looking for. We are sending the project to Nashville for mixing, and hopeful that it will be mixed and mastered to our satisfaction. We may not get enough funds, and need to push out the project even further.
