Many people just like you and me find it hard to continue submitting resumes after resumes without knowing if your resume was seen or was headed straight to the trash bin. Imagine giving a once in a lifetime 15 second commercial to a potential employer; what will you say, how will you say it, and how will you look? At what you see is me (wycizmee) our goal is to make you stand out from the crowd. You not only want your resume reviewed but you want to be heard and seen thus increasing your chances for an actual interview and future success. Risks and challenges Thank you for this great opportunity to present and view my project. First of I am not an expert in developing websites I only have a basic understanding. As I thought about this particular project I concluded that this needs to be developed by an expert. My first challenge was to look for a refutable one to work with. I researched several companies and was quoted between $8k to $14 for a truly interactive design. As I pondered through this, I do not have the funds necessary to complete this project which is why I am presenting my idea to Kickstarter. If my project is funded I will do my best to make sure the website is functional and works to help people who are in need specially now that many people are out of work. I truly believe that to succeed in todays world we need to use the technology available to us. My goal is to have this completed and published live by the end of the year or early next year. Thank you for your support. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
