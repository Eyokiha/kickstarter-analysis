At The ShopSo far 440 Films has been able to self fund two episodes of At The Shop. We are really excited about the positive feedback and consistent growing number of views of our first two episodes. However to make more episodes and keep momentum we need capital! Collectively At The Shop has over 115,000 views in TWO short month's! Please take a moment to view our first two episodes and if you like what you see pledge on the right!!! ----->MANY MANY Thanks!!!AT THE SHOP EPISODE 1-- THE INVITE: Scott, Justin and Reggie get invited to a speed dating event. Will they go? Will they get lucky? AT THE SHOP EPISODE 2-- SPEED DATING: Scott, Justin and Reggie accept the invitation and encounter many stereotypical women! Risks and challenges There always Risks and challenges in anything. We cut down on risk by pre-production and keeping a tight nit production crew. 440 has already shot a few episodes that gives us a leg up on potentially issues. So far we've been operating on a shoe string budget of our own money. The biggest challenges we have is getting money for future episodes. Having additional funds would mean more episodes taking "At The Shop" from every other month to bi-weekly episodes! To do this we need your help. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
