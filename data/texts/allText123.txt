Who are Life is Heller? Life is Heller is a musical collaboration between a son (Owen Heller), his sister (Lily Heller) and their father (Justin Heller). Owen is 11 years old and Lily is 7. What is "Me in a Bubble"? It is our debut album that features 14 original songs all composed on an iPad2 using Garage Band. We worked on all the songs together and had a lot of fun creating the music. We found that a combination of musical styles fused together worked for us, although the foundational genre is Electronic/Dance.We found inspiration in the music of Daft Punk, whom the three of us like very much. Spontaneous situations in our lives also helped us in selecting song titles (see video.) Why Pledge? When you help fund our project, you will enable us to get share our music with (hopefully) the world. We want others to hear what we created. We also tried to make the rewards cool, to show you how much we appreciate your help!Where will the money go?Money raised from your kind donations will be used to pay for the costs associated with paying a music distributor to publish our music on iTunes. This includes the fees for the UPC code required. Funds will also be used to promote the album and our band.Want to see more?Original music video of our song "Tyranny" and featuring animation created by Owen Heller on his Nintendo 3DS
