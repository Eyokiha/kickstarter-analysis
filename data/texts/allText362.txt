Unemployment Quest is a game about the experience of unemployed youth.Many of today's youth have graduated school and been unable to find work in any substantial way. As I was playing an old RPG, I realized that there don't seem to be any games that really speak to my demographic. This game is an attempt to create something which can speak to the player's real-world experience, beyond focusing on high-fantasy. The story is minimalistic as the game is not about an epic adventure so much as trying to reach a very simple goal.Instead of fighting typical fantasy monsters, your foes will include "Doubts," "Isolation," "Shame," and the main villain "Uncertain Future."The aim of the game is to turn the negative experience of joblessness into something less terrible, while still having fun gameplay that will not bog down players by requiring gigantic time investments.The game features an original score composed on Korg DS-10+ for Nintendo DS, designed to replicate the feel of old soundtracks to games from the 8 and 16-bit eras. Further, original 8-bit sound effects are made using Nanoloop for the Nintendo Game Boy. The game itself is being made in RPG Maker VX Ace, which is a great game-building tool.This Kickstarter is specifically to fund the existence of a physical CD version of the game, which I'm aiming to sell at this year's ConnectiCon. The CDs will not be for sale outside of conventions and it has yet to be decided if it will even be available at other cons. So pledging $10 is the only way to guarantee a copy! The CDs I want made are serious, professionally replicated discs rather than cheapo CD-Rs and will most likely come packaged in a slimline plastic case with an original illustration by illustrator Rayna Sassano as the cover.
