Read more about Legislative News and what we're all about at http://www.legislativenews.us/about-us/ About the Legislative News Team Rick Wilson: Director of Operations Rick Wilson Rick spent over thirty years working in the construction industry and has always been fascinated with history. He learned one of the earliest forms of a representative government was formed by the Jewish people in the Old Testament. This along with studying the early American western frontier sparked his interest in the struggle and the founding of America, the development of the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution, and the development and the debate of the Constitution. From these studies Rick both realized and understood the duty of citizens in a true representative government of the people.Rick moved his studies in to how the laws in the United States are made, what legislation passed the United States Congress last week, and what legislation is scheduled for action or a vote next week. He studied a variety of poll topics from the major polling organizations, and discovered he, generally, had more in common with the respondents of those polls then differences. From keeping up with current legislation he also discovered most of the time the United States Congress fell behind the will of the majority in those poll results.This moved Rick in to deeper studies of how the laws that govern a free society are actually created, special interest groups, lobbyist, the power of money in government and the corruption of it all. During these studies one overriding theme continued to push forward, the true power in the United States government still lays in the hands of the People, [if they will use it]. Benjamin FranklinRick then wanted to use the advances in information technology to connect American citizens with legislative decisions that affect the lives of all of us. He wanted to make it easy for citizens to use this information, to voice their opinions, to hold their representative and senators accountable and for the United States Congress to know what their constituents think. There were two people Rick thought about over the years and hoped he would be able to convince them to come on board with this idea of creating a Legislative News website, designed to help make a connection between citizens, their representative and their senators and to bring the Peoples the voice in government. This came to pass, Miranda coming on board in 2014 and Adam in 2016.Miranda Wilson: Assistant Director of Operations Miranda Wilson Miranda grew up in western Colorado. In elementary school she had the opportunity to make a unique friendship with Adam. She was also blessed with the opportunity to live outside of town where her family could have horses and livestock and she could participate in 4-H and FFA. Her mom being active in the military, was stationed all over the country throughout her childhood giving Miranda the opportunity to see and experience all kinds of people and places in the United States. During high school Adam and Miranda drifted apart. After high school graduation, she and Adam both attended CSU where she earned a bachelor of science through the Equine Science program and Adam a degree in Computer Science. Miranda then began her pursuit of a lifelong dream of a career training horses as she worked as an assistant trainer for a well-respected and talented horseman. A couple years later she went back to school for a masters in secondary education. Miranda could not shake the overwhelming need to give back to society and her community. So at the same time she pursued her masters, Miranda began teaching high school science in a southern Arizona classroom. She became the science department chair investing her time and heart into her students. After a couple of years teaching and a season working in Yellowstone National Park, she made her way back home to the mountains and plateaus of Colorado and began her work with Legislativenews.us.As Miranda began her journey through several different careers, trying to figure out how to best use her skills and talents, it became apparent to her just how difficult it was to fulfill her civic duties by being politically active, find the time to stay abreast political issues that matter, and voice her opinion on the legislation and politics that she cared about. Miranda has always appreciated the opportunities and ability she has had to make her life what she wanted and pursue her dreams and goals in this country. Learning about the history and founding of the country from her dad and books and having the chance to travel and live in several different parts of the country, gave her a deep seeded sense of belonging, ownership, and stewardship over the country she calls home. However, it seems to her that government has gotten too big and disconnected from the people that it is put in place to serve. This frustration is what drives her passion and purpose for her work with legislativenews.us.Adam Campfield: Director of Technology Adam Campfield Adam is a four time cancer survivor, black belt, book worm, musician and technology nerd. He enjoys games of almost all sorts, chocolate chip cookies, wolves and rock music. He was born in Loma Linda, California in 1989 and moved to Grand Junction, Colorado in 1995. There, in the first grade, Miranda Wilson was one of the first students he interacted with. They quickly became best friends, spending recesses and time after school at Adam's house together for years. Growing up, Adam studied martial arts, achieving his black belt at age fourteen, as well as a number of musical instruments. These included the trumpet, recorder, vocals and drums, but he discovered his true passion for music around age fourteen when he was introduced to alternative rock by a friend. He has been a dedicated drummer ever since.Though Miranda and Adam had drifted apart somewhat during High School, they both went on to study at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, Adam in computer science and Miranda in Equine science. Adam's graduation was delayed by being the first blind student to enter a hard science at CSU and having various accommodations and adaptations for classes performed as experiments that were sometimes unsuccessful. A relapse of cancer and various other illnesses also played a role. He finally graduated in December 2015. In June 2016, while Adam was sending out job applications mostly for positions he didn't really want, Rick Wilson, Miranda's father, contacted him and told him about the Legislative News project. Knowing that Adam had studied computing, Rick asked if Adam would be interested in joining himself and Miranda on the Legislative News team, acting as head of technology. And so, bringing life into a strange sort of circle, Adam officially joined the team on July 2, 2016, ready for one heck of a ride.Credits We at Legislative News would like to thank the following for their contributions to this project:Jordan Miller and Alden Roelant, from Purpose Driven Films, for helping to script, then film and produce our video.
