My goal is to share with everyone everyday experiences while building bridges and or freeways. My pictures will be portraying the entire process of bridge work as a behind the scenes look.I will try to take you in a journey to see processes that are rarely seen by people. You will have a new understanding of construction work not only as a cause for traffic but as an art. Multiple phases are involved from cap building to rebar tying,culminating with sometimes 10+hours of concrete pouring.From tired crews to individual people, you will have a chance to see it all. All the pictures will be first hand pictures taken by me. I am not a professional photographer, nor a journalist or author. I am a construction worker who takes pride in his job and would like everyone to take a glimpse into what we do. Risks and challenges Risk involved if funded are delay in printing books/pictures. I will verify status of the entire process to keep everyone interested up to date. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
