Tired of tripping over things in the dark at night? Need a light that doesn't blind your eyes for your nighttime bathroom trips? Want a cute fluffy companion that glows in a myriad of beautiful colors? Say hello to LumiCat, a cute plushie cat that lights up when it detects motion! LumiCat has 7 full color LEDs which change their colors slowly and smoothly. Smooth color-changing (5x play speed) The lights on LumiCat have two modes: Motion and light activated mode In this mode, LumiCat will only light up when it detects motion at night, which is activated by its PIR sensor and light sensor. The PIR sensor detects the body motion in front of it within a 110Â° scope, and has an effective range of about 10 feet. The light sensor detects the darkness of its surroundings. Only when both sensors are activated will the LED lights be turned on. The lights will be automatically turned off if no other motion is detected for 30 seconds. This mode is best used when you want to use LumiCat as a night light, which can be useful for nighttime bathroom trips, venturing into the dark unknowns of your house, etc. Always-on mode In this mode, the lights are always on, and can only be turned off by the switch. The switch has OFF/ON/AUTO positions, which represent power off, always-on mode, and motion and light activated mode respectively. The current version of LumiCat is powered by 3 AA batteries. There is a stretch goal for the rechargeable battery version.Stretch Goal Rewards Timeline Risks and challenges The prototype of LumiCat is already functional, and the manufacturer to produce LumiCats is already confirmed. If this project is successfully funded, they will complete the production on schedule. However, there is always a possibility of delays due to unforeseen circumstances. I will keep everyone up to date on the progress and work hard to make this project a success! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
