Hello. My name is Scott. And I am making an autobiographical narrative art film titled Oculus. I want to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about the film and why I'm doing it.The FilmOculus is a journey through beauty, through love, through life and death as seen through my eyes. It weaves together the tale of my life over the last four years working as a photographer in South Beach. It is the tale of a man who has taken hundreds of thousands of photographs both of people on the street and of erotic nude models in the apartments and hotel rooms above them. Oculus is the tale of a sexy and sometimes not so sexy world.Beyond the world of photography, Oculus aims to present the beauty in humanity through an absurd tapestry of experiences, providing answers to questions such as why I would travel alone for three months across the United States and back on a 50cc scooter, why I would move to Miami to begin with, and why, after my oldest son took his life, I would remain here.Oculus is a winding tale of the circles we find ourselves in and the patterns of life. It is humor, it is sexiness, it is tragedy. It is life. With this film, I intend to show the viewer the world through my eyes. My purpose? To spread goodness. This is what I hope to accomplish with Oculus.ProductionOn this film, I am wearing nearly all hats: Writer, director, director of cinematography and photography, audio engineer, editor, and producer.Acting will be performed by others.
