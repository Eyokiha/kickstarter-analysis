We need enough money to pay for a new van, and we just don't have it on our own. Only a few days remain until we need to meet our goal of $5,000, otherwise all of the pledged donations are returned. We don't have a record label, manager, or booking agent, so we need YOUR help NOW!Help us get to all of our exciting bookings this summer such as: Mountain Jam (NY), Clearwater (NY), Whispering Beard (IN), and Bristol Rhythm n' Roots (TN).Time is running out, so please help now!If you'd like something specific, or to help in another way, write to spiritfamilyreunionusa@gmail.comfacebook.com/spiritfamilyreunion
