I have recorded an album of original music with it's heart in the North East of Scotland, The album is a mixture of Doric songs and traditional tunes, I just need to get the CD mixed, mastered and manufactured. By pre ordering a copy of this great album you can be part of the process to get this multi faceted music project out to the world. The songs are written in the dialect from North East Scotland, 'Doric' And have themes from the history of the area, Fishing, Farming and Peat cutting. The tunes are inspired by the unique sound of NE Scotland's traditional music and reflect the areas rich and vibrant culture.The album features some of the finest traditional musicians from Scotland's most popular bands, Treacherous Orchestra, Old Blind Dogs and Session A9. Risks and challenges I am an experienced fulltime working muscian, with an unrelenting passion for music, art and the great people I meet along the way. I have been involved in other successful recording projects in the past and have always had great feedback. The album is recorded, so there are no risks or challenges, It merely awaits professional mixing and mastering and finally manufacturing. Get involved now, become a backer and come with me over the final hurdle to see this great artistic project come to fruition. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
