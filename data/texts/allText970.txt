Our Mission: Creating a place for innovators to share practical insights, raising the capability of innovation around the world. www.thinkdifferentanyday.comWe are building a platform to give people the opportunity to share their practical insights in driving innoation. We want people to host 'Think Different' events in their workplace, all around the world and put the innovators on stage for everyone to learn from. We believe by making knowledge accessible through 7-10 minute micro learning videos we can collectively raise the 'knowledge level' and build capability around the world. Our platform will also enable and seed fund collaborators on their own innovations they want to bring to the world.We want to make the world a better place to live and work in and through this shared platform we believe we can create this change. Risks and challenges We need content. We are busy already creating content and will have many hours when we launch. We'd love for our backers to share their stories too and will make this available in the Beta release. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
