What I want to do is tell the story "Twas the Night" cinematically and through incredible performances. The story is dramatic, touching, up lifting and heart breaking. Told through the eyes of a young asthmatic child on Christmas Eve, the story follows him and his mother on there journey of the night. Both of the characters find meaning, truth and love through out this holiday night, and finally end up finding meaning in each other in the end. I plan on making this film with the help of industry professionals, and with my own industry experience as it will play as the back bone to this production, please see my profile to find more information about my self. The money that is being sponsored to the project will be used for equipment rentals, transportation of cast and crew, professional services, professionals, actors, locations and post production (audio mixing, scoring and so on) lights and cameras. The sponsored amount that I have posted to this site is still not enough to cover all the expenses needed, the remainder will be contributed from other sources.
