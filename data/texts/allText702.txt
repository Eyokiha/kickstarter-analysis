What is GoHub?GoHub is the world's smallest USB-C hub that clips on your keychain.

Please see below for more information.) GoHub - The ultimate USB-C solution for your new Macbook. Forget about Adapters. Altogether. Your new Macbook is designed for ultimate portability and elegance. Leave the clumsy adapters at home. Just grab your MacBook and go - Your ports will always be there when you need it. GoHub: You won't even feel it in your pocket. With GoHub, an USB port will always be available on your new MacBook.
