All the rewards that include the word "subscription" have been eliminated.THE 60-SECOND STORY(If you need to get back to playing with your pup!) Why FitBark? Wouldn't it be great if dog parenting came with instructions? We always wonder whether there's a better way to stay connected with our dogs. Have you ever asked yourself: Is my dog doing alright? Is he getting the right amount of exercise today, this week or this month? Has he been walked today? What is he doing when he's home alone? Is he sleeping? How can I stay close to him when he’s sick? Is he more or less energetic than the other dogs?What is FitBark? FitBark is a tiny, stylish, dog-bone shaped device that attaches to your dog’s collar and records physical activity 24/7. Whenever your pooch comes within the Bluetooth range of any one of the paired smartphones (owners and caretakers) or the FitBark home base (similar to a router), the information is uploaded to the FitBark system in real time, and is viewable in the FitBark mobile app by all the owners and caretakers of your dog. FitBark is super tiny (0.022 lb, or 10 grams), fashionable, comfortable and easy to put on, fits easily onto the vast majority of dog collars and is water resistant. It comes in green, light blue, fuchsia, beige, and red (we’ll ask what color you prefer at the end of the campaign). What is the FitBark mobile app? It’s your way to feel better connected as a pet parent (even when you’re out of town!) while raising a happy, healthy dog. We calculate a daily goal for your dog, and you watch the percent counter advance throughout the day, with the background colors changing accordingly. You and other caretakers can also visualize this big dog data in hourly, daily, weekly and monthly summaries, so that you can work as a team and take action when necessary. All that data is also used to calculate the BarkScore – the number that tells you how consistently your dog has been meeting his daily goal and how well you're doing as a dog parent. Oh, and you’ll be able to answer all the other questions from the first paragraph. We like to think FitBark is Dog Parenting 2.0. What smartphones is FitBark compatible with? iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPad 3, iPad mini, iPod touch (5th gen ) Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, Note II, 10.1 If your iOS or Android smartphone is not on the list, you won't be able to sync up FitBark wirelessly through your smartphone, but you’ll still be able to use the FitBark app and visualize data that synced up through a compatible smartphone or the FitBark home base (iOS 6.0+ or Android 4.0+ required) FitBark works everywhere, not only in the US!

Who's been barking about usDogster - "The device lets you track your dog's daily activity levels using your smartphone. How cool is that?"..."And the bone shape is quite handsome"Techcrunch - "I can see how loving, caring and yes, reasonable pet owners might like to see this data about their dogs"Mashable - "You can see exactly when a caretaker took your furry friend for a walk, and how long the walk was"Engadget - "Sometimes it's tough for busy owners to know precisely when their furry best friend is getting enough activity"Crunchwear - "May be the coolest piece of technology to snap around your dog’s neck since the invention of the humble collar"The Barking Lot - "If you’re a dog lover and a device lover, I just might have the coolest thing ever for you. Enter FitBark"Digital Trends - "It could also be used by doggy daycare providers, basically giving owners the ability to check in on their pets from time to time during the day"Are we really doing what's best for our dogs? Daysie has something to tell you. Ever ask yourself: Am I a good dog parent? Am I doing what's best for my dog at all times? How is he doing right now? What time did he go for a walk? Did my friend or dog walker really walk him or has he been lazying about it? Did my dog have enough activity today, this week, or even this month? How consistently has he been hitting his daily goal? I'm a first time dog owner: what is the right amount of activity for my dog? What is he doing when he's home alone? Is he sleeping? If I need to travel for a few days, how is his caretaker or doggie day care treating him? Is he more or less energetic than the other dogs? How can I help him lose weight? If he's not feeling well today, how is he doing right this second? How can I monitor and chart his recovery after he's been sick? What do I say when the vet asks: "How was his energy level in the past few days or weeks"? We created FitBark to start answering all these questions, and many more. Yup, FitBark is a high-tech dog bone. Wouldn't it be great if dog parenting came with instructions? Well, we certainly thought so. For starters, we believe that as good parents, it is our responsibility to check on our dogs as frequently as we can so that we know that they're safe and healthy. In addition, just like us, our dogs need a minimum amount of daily exercise to lead a healthy and happy life. With the FitBark device, the FitBark home base, and the accompanying mobile app, we can see how their energy level is changing at any given moment. Here is how it works: We calculate a minimum daily goal for your dog that is equivalent to one hour of moderately intense physical activity, and the rest of the day spent at a lower energy level We call that goal 100% (simple enough?) You watch the percent counter advance throughout the day, with the background colors changing accordingly When your dog meets his daily goal, you can be sure that you've done your job as a dog parent Review hourly, daily, weekly and monthly trends to visually identify patterns and leverage the power of big dog data All of FitBark’s activity data feeds into the BarkScore: the number that tells you how consistently your dog has been meeting his daily goal, and how you're doing as a dog parent. Big dog data at your fingertips See FitBark beta in action! Here's Louis (aka Sir Poopalott) wearing an early FitBark prototype while out on a morning walk. Notice the percent counter increasing as he sniffs around and marks his territories. Note: This is unedited. The app shown is an early beta version and not what you'll actually see in the Apple Store and Google Play. FitBark is super tiny, fashionable, comfortable and easy to put on FitBark has been specially designed to fit easily onto the vast majority of dog collars. We have successfully tested it on dogs of 6 pounds and above, and collar sizes from 0.31 inch (8 mm) to 1.06 inch (27 mm) in width. However, we wouldn't be surprised if you used it happily on smaller dogs, or wider collars. Collar thickness is not usually an issue, as we include rubber bands of various sizes in the box. Check out this brief video to see how easy it is to attach FitBark to your dog's collar. You can literally move FitBark across collars in seconds. Sized at 1.6 inch (41 mm), FitBark does not interfere with your dog’s movements, and chances are he won't even notice it. FitBark is also water-resistant, so if your dog gets wet, no sweat. How good do we feel about FitBark's design? Pretty good: collectively, our team has 15 years of experience designing, prototyping and bringing to market accessories for dogs. If you would like to see a few cool computer-generated images of FitBark, click here. FitBark comes in five colors: green, light blue, fuchsia, beige and red. After the end of the campaign, we'll make sure to send you a quick survey so that you can specify what color you prefer. The FitBark experience is barkingly brilliant (and seamless) When we started to design FitBark, we realized that one dog is generally cared for by several owners (ourselves, parents, siblings, spouse, kids etc.) and caretakers (friends, dog walker, day care etc.) who may not be all equally tech savvy. That's why we decided to keep things simple. Here's how it works: When you get your dog a FitBark, the first thing you do is pair the device with your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0 / Bluetooth LE Next, open the FitBark app and invite other owners and caretakers of your dog to join the pack :) From the app, don't forget to configure the FitBark home base with your home Wi-Fi login and password With no reason to remove it from the collar, FitBark tracks your dog's activity 24/7 and stores it in its memory. Whenever the collar device is within the Bluetooth range of any one of the paired smartphones or the FitBark home base, it pushes all the new activity data (since the last sync) to FitBark's web server All that information is interpreted and visualized in real time on your phone as well as the phones of other owners and caretakers of your dog (with certain privacy limitations in the latter case) By default, the FitBark home base spreads the love, allowing any dog wearing a FitBark device to sync up his data to our server. You can change that setting to only allow a few, selected dogs to sync up if you wish. Ready to be a part of the fun? We would love for you to be a part of our journey! For our Kickstarter campaign only, we are offering FitBark at a discount from our final retail price. This is to show love to our initial backers.

Hiroshi brings lots of love from Italy. What we've been up to The team at FitBark is small but growing and, shall we say, dogged in our determination. Up to this point, we have been able to create 30 fully functional prototypes (check out a FitBark come to life here) with the help of dedicated and smart folks who have put in their time and love in the past 12 months to get us to this point. If you are curious to see a few of our early prototypes, make sure to check out this Pinterest board. We are now debugging our iOS mobile app, fine-tuning our web server and learning new tricks day after day, one dog at a time. By supporting our campaign, you will give us the ability to get into mass production mode, which requires finalizing the manufacturing process, selecting the right partners to work with and acquiring additional engineering resources. A bone's inner beauty, visualized. Live. Love. Wag. We are Team FitBark We are a diverse bunch of folks who cannot stay away from dogs & tech to save our lives. Team FitBark is proudly based in NYC, and is lucky enough to have the support of many other amazingly talented individuals from Italy and other countries. You can learn more about us here, and in the FAQs below. Team FitBark at work with Beefy and Patrick...work, really? Finally, a big paw-five and thank you to: Parallel play media Risks and challenges The FitBark team has decades of collective experience building consumer products that revolve around technology. Because we've been down this road before, we know that there could be bumps along the way, and we've gotten pretty good at flagging technical challenges upfront to make sure that we can deliver a product that delights and satisfies users. In fact, we already have 30 working prototypes of our device. With that said, a tech project like FitBark, which includes both hardware and software components, can be a little trickier to operate than usual. For instance, we need to ensure that we can secure all the necessary components to manufacture the devices, including the home base. But fear not! We've already been in touch with multiple suppliers so that our production targets can be met. Contingency planning is woven into not only our procurement, but all aspects of product planning and delivery. And you can help us! By pledging to buy a FitBark, and spreading the word to your friends, we can gather more certainty on the demand, which will make it easier to work with suppliers. The greater the demand, the better price we can negotiate, and the easier it is to bring FitBark to the masses. It also helps us plan for future generations of our product (and we've got some pretty neat ideas here). So share the love. And make sure to live life full of wag. Woof!
