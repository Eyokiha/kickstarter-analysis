After seeing the idea online I have decided that a great idea for a website would involve a room of kittens and a user controlled robot that allows them to interact with with the kittens and play with them for varying amounts of time. This would not only allow for people who love cats to interact with them in a fun new way but also provide a fun stress outlet to be used freely. The general setup will involve one or more robots and several kittens to participate safely in playing together by setting up a queue that will monitor how long each user has been on as well as who is next. This robot will be equipped with many functional toys that will aid in this such as laser pointers, toys on strings, etc. The kittens that will be used will be adopted from a local humane society, Aggieland Humane Society, in order to provide these kittens with a loving home where they will have all the attention necessary. Risks and challenges The biggest challenge for this is producing the funds to build the robot in question. Using my background in aerospace engineering I am confident in my abilities to be able to build the robot but the problem lies in being able to fund it. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
