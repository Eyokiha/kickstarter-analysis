The main goal of our project is to bring a full range of fitness into your home. Fitness should be for all who are motivated enough to take the journey to a healthy life. Unfortunately, many individuals do not venture into the gym due to expense, time, or fear of being judged. Our project will use technology to bring a full range of classes taught by experts into your home. We will use two modes of technological delivery and 5 foundations of fitness. There will be two levels of instruction, one being for the average person looking to burn calories, build lean muscle, and develop healthy habits. The second level of instruction will be for the serious body builder or fitness competitor. The two modes of technological delivery will be through you tube subscription and instructional tapes. These modes of delivery through technology will allow the busy individual to take classes in the 5 foundations of fitness at their convenience and time schedule in the privacy of their own home. The 5 foundations of fitness are strength (body building, spot toning exercises), flexibility (pilates and yoga), cardio high interval training (dance, cardio exercises), nutrition, and psychological motivation. Commitments have been secured from Mr. Olympia World 2002 Stan Frydich, a psychologist, a nutritionist, and certified pilates, yoga, and cross-fit trainers. Help me bring fitness into homes all over the world! Risks and challenges Securing expert fitness instructors consistently for the fitness channel and videos would be a challenge to most individuals. However, I own a gym where not only can qualified stable certified fitness instructors be found, but filming can be done in a consistent setting. Keeping top trainers like Mr. Olympia World involved could be a challenge. However, these trainers including Mr. Olympia World are under contract currently and have agreed to fulfill the requirements needed to complete this project. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
