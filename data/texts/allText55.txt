The goal of this project is to journey to and document my spiritual Pilgrimage to Wales. I will be living my Core Desired Feelings of Courage and Sovereign. The trip will be through Cardiff, Snowdonia, Llyn y Fan Fach and Bala among other destinations.I have accommodations and meals paid for, my flight is the challenge. My flight was derailed due to an unexpected expense related to one of my children.With your help I will be able to complete this journey and share the images and energy with you. Risks and challenges I'm not a professional photographer! My photographs are intended to capture the energy and share the landscapes of my Pilgrimage with you, my supporters.
