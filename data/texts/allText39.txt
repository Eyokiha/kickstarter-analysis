Myself and a group of fellow Walking/Hiking and climbing Photographers recently sat around a table in the “Kings House Hotel” in Glencoe and commented that they all had various books covering the walk and the area but simply hated carrying them. No one person was happy with one book or the other and some had photographic books showing the beautiful countryside and others had books on routes to walk.One thing we all had ….Our phones and some even tablets… So the idea was born and we began on our new journey using our skills as photographers infused with our passion for walking and hiking to make a digital book that we could carry at no extra weight to us. We are making a complete guide to all National Parks and areas of beauty including. With the book being a digital version we have a lot of creative freedom and will include:100s of expertly taken photos.Fully usable guides to walks in each of these beautiful areas. Local information. Stories from some of the locals on the history of the areas.There will be much more included but we want to keep it a surprise for all. Please help us promote the natural beauty we all share in this Great Britain and allow us to create this beautiful dynamic guide. We will be selling The Ebook at a very low price (A couple of pounds - currently undecided) as we do not want to make a profit from this simply promote the beauty of our land and help those like us explore these beautiful areas. Risks and challenges The only risk attached would be the old English weather and not being able to complete the photography work in time. We plan to tackle this by simple being available as often as possible to get to the locations and shoot. We will keep backers up to date on the progress and are considering a Facebook page to support our work. The design of the book has already been put together along with the detail that we need. We are passionate about this and will make this a success. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
