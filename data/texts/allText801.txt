All summer long I had this idea of making a social media site where slowness and reflection was in focus, because we (me and my wife) feel this is a real lack on a lot of other social sites on the net where everything is very fast and superficial.The original idea was very strange. I think Surface is still strange. What do you think? (In a way, the world is a strange place too.)The idea is to write to a friend and this communication will be public to others who may find inspiration in the love that transpires from the communication between two friends. Risks and challenges We don't know much about how the users will react to the general idea. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
