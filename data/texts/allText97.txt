Hi! I'm Sarah! I'm a Penn State student, wife, and momma and I love it here in Happy Valley. I get to walk around campus seeing all of the timeless, beautiful sights that University Park has to offer and all of the charm of State College, but have no way to capture it (not even a smart phone!). I would like to invest in a quality camera (a Canon Rebel t5i) and a good lens (feel free to suggest!) to be able to put together a series of portraits to capture the experience of being here and being part of Penn State. Time passes by so quickly and I want to be able to remember and share all of the moments that I see on a daily basis that so often make me pause just to take them in; the things I see that make me appreciate just being here for a while. I know there are so many of you that have been here before that can understand wanting to remember and share the experience. That is why I'm counting on YOU Penn State Alumni!!! I know you can get behind this! After the project is complete, I plan to use the camera to document more "day in the life" moments of my 3 year old daughter and our family life here in Happy Valley. Time is fleeting and I don't want to forget a single moment...and I want to help you remember! Risks and challenges The challenge I foresee being most likely is setting up a website to display the photos. Since there are many resources to help with this, I should be able to navigate this challenge quite successfully. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
