I love to travel. You love to travel. I can't always do it. You can't always do it. Wish you were here is a project built out of that feeling of wishing you could go somewhere, or wishing that someone else could be there with you. New York is one of those quintessential destinations. This project is about the postcards and photographs we use to savor when they were analog and printed, before you could show a journey on social media. If you have never been to NYC, can't go soon, love penpals, love photographs, polaroids, postcards or travel then this project is for you. I just want to send out some awesome art and share new york with everyone. I love the feeling of old fashioned snail mail. Feel free to write me back if you receive one of the postcards! Risks and challenges The biggest problem that could come up is dealing with the bumps and surprises of traveling. Traveling is full of the unknown. My middle name is travel. OK its not but if I wasn't trying to fund this project I would be paying to have it legally changed. So I think we'll be okay. Fingers crossed. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
