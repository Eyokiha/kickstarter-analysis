HELLO MY NAME IS G-CODE AND I AM A SCREEN WRITER/MUSIC ARTIST AND I DO SHORT SKITS THAT I CALL (WAT WUD U DO?) AND I CREATE SCARY AND THRILLING SITUATIONS THAT HAS NO SOLUTION, SO THAT ALLOWS THE PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR OPINION TO WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND BY IT BEING A THRILLER IT USUALLY HAS SCENES THAT ARE NAIL BITING. I'M TRYING TO CREATE MORE AND MORE BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW I DONT HAVE THE BUDGET TO PAY ACTORS AND ACTRESSES. I NEED HELP WITH EQUIPMENT AND LIGHTING SO I CAN BRING TO LIFE MY IDEAS. WITH YOUR HELP I WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME EPIC CONTENT. I AM ALSO ASKING FOR HELP TO COMPLETE MY MUSIC ALBUM CALLED (THE SEPHIA) IT'S ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE SLEEPING IN MY CAR AND HAVING NOWHERE TO GO. I AM A INSPIRATION RAPPER THAT DOESN'T USE PROFANITY IN MY (SOLO) MUSIC. I DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS RIGHT NOW FOR STUDIO TIME NOR THE FUNDS TO MAKE MUSIC VIDEOS. EVEN THOUGH I KNOW HOW TO DO MUSIC VIDEOS I HAVE NO ONE TO ASSIST ME AND THAT'S WHERE HAVING A BUDGET WOULD HELP. I APPRECIATE YOU READING MY BIO AND HOPE YOU SEE MY VISION AND MAYBE WE COULD CREATE SOMETHING LEGENDARY. HAVE A GREAT DAY.... Risks and challenges THE CHALLENGES THAT MAY COME UP FOR ME IS FINDING ACTORS AND ACTRESSES TO PLAY CERTAIN ROLES BUT THANK GOD I AM IN ATLANTA SO THEY'RE PLENTY OF TALENT AND INSPIRING ACTORS WHO WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UP THEIR REEL FOR MORE SERIOUS PAYING ROLES.
