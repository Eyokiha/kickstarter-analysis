We have a lot of experience in the fish business and have a lot of connections and recipes. We won't be using a wet mixture which is called a Batter but we will be using a very tasty, with a lot of spices flour mixture. This wont soak up all the oil and wont be very heavy. Why we need the support?We need the money to start us off by opening around 10 restaurants around London and surrounding areas. Also within 2 Years we will be around the whole of United Kingdom. We will be opening 1 restaurant every 2 weeks. We will open around 5 fast food chains in Central London, 1 in North London, 1 in South London, 1 in West London, 1 in East London and 1 in Manchester for our Launch. This Money will also help you support our project and to make London Healthy again. The funds from this event will go towards, securing better commercial kitchen space, advertising and marketing, more equipment to keep up with demand, setting up packaging, purchasing of materials and acquiring wholesale licenses. Risks and challenges As of right now, this is a family operations, and with that comes some limitations. High capacity production is a challenge for us right now. By efficiently using the new equipment while simultaneously meeting demand. We have streamlined production and made steps to shorten the production and bottling time frame. By taking in our customers feedback and learning from past events, we have grown confident in our ability to provide greatness in a jar effectively. Seeing our customers reaction to tasting Out of the Sea makes the long hours and smelling like Fish all worth it.ch Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
