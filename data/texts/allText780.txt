In a century where many consumers have progressed towards the age of information, we continue to see glimpses of processes of the past. In the past few years consumers have transformed their ability to buy consumer goods. With new services such as pick up in store and ship to home, there has been a constant decline in retail store sales. With expenses that are required, comes an idea that may transform a consumer buying experience all together. The idea of rBox hopes to dissolve many iterative points of a buying experience. It allows for the ability to track every single purchase made, with any form of payment and at any location. This allows for easier expense management for consumers, notably small businesses and greater consumer insight for retailers (coupons, promotions for frequently purchased items). Being able to store your receipts in one central location while being able to monitor and control your expenses is a tool that will empower consumers and businesses alike in a time where every dollar matters.The rBox team hopes to use the funds raised to develop this application and provide consumers and businesses a more streamlined purchasing process. Risks and challenges Some challenges we may face will be around cooperation from retailers. Being able to store a receipt involves very heavy footwork (imaging, coding for items purchased, payment methods used). To overcome this obstacle, we hope to work with many retailers on establishing a streamlined process for receipt layouts. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
