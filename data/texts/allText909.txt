Perfect Skate Spots / PSS Will be the first & only Social media platform just for skaters, It's amazing how skating has evolved & is continuing to grow but yet we don't have a website to call home, A website that would help connect amateur skaters to other around them, plus a place where sponsors can see the next best skater, A website that knows all of your area, the secret spots you've always wondered about, now right at your feet to skate & upload pictures & videos to your profile for the world to see how great you are, there will be much much more features & ways to connect through PSS for skaters, if you'd like to hear more feel free to contact me @ Marcusking7766@gmail.com Risks and challenges I have a company that will make & help advertise once I have the funds to create my dream, The only risks is not trying, I know from being a skater how much this would effect the world of skating in a positive way. starting to late is a risk.
