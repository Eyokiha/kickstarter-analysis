This audio sample was made with incredibly outdated software and a computer that " somehow works" despite being a decade old and having numerous problems. Upon being successful, my kick start will fund a complete ( on the cheap side) home studio, where I will record myself and collaborate with others in an effort to add positive and uplifting vibes into the electronic music scene. Risks and challenges The most challenging part about this project is finding the time to do it. I currently work 40 hours a week and I still ( to my girlfriend's dismay) find plenty of time crunch on new songs every day. My dream is the same as everyone else, to do what I love and make a living for myself in the process. If your hobby becomes a job, then you don't have to work a day in your life, you get to play!
