Basically, I am raising funds to turn a short story that I heard when I was younger into a short film. I have been writing ideas for movies since I was around 10 or so. I always thought about things that I would find scary or thrilling and tried to come up with ways to make them appeal to more folks. As I have gotten older and had children I have encouraged them to exercise their imagination as well. My oldest son turns fourteen this summer and I am trying to instill the creativity and desire in him to get into making films. It is a great medium for storytelling and is a way to leave a mark on the world. While I do enjoy scary stories some of my other ideas are comedies and more family friendly films, mainly aimed to pre-teens and teens. Sports stories or outdoors adventure type projects. If this works out I look forward to creating more in the future. Risks and challenges There will always be risks associated with any project. Some of the risks associated with creating a film would be difficulty with actors, different crew components, access to locations, and shortage of resources. I plan to make this film completely local. The mid-michigan area is replete with locations that could be useful in filming. I have been recruiting people that would also be able to help who have previous film knowledge. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
