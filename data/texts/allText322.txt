He mounted his sky chariot carried by four powerful birds and set foot in the sky. But there was the powerful sky angel stopping his imaginations and ruling desire. It was when a glowing spirit of a child appeared in front of him. “I am KayKhosrow.” Whispered the child. “Son of Siavoosh, Son of Kavoos! If you now destroy this man due to his many sins, you have destroyed my father and robbed of my future existence!” Thought the angel for a glance, then by just a touch, threw the chariot of rebellious king to earth where he first came from. “And I have not the order to destroy your ancestor hence returned him alive to his land but you will have much burden to carry! The angel whispered to KayKhosrow “Big battles will happen between your ancestors and you will end cruelties of the time. When that time comes, evil forces will attack borders of Persia and will come the time of vengeance for your people. Now, rest at peace for your time is yet to come…” --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Simorgh 3D Simorgh 3D is our level editor which we used to create the world of our game with.

Risks and challenges Developing a video game always requires the cooperation of many people, so technical risks are unavoidable. However, since the development of Legends of Persia already completed more than two-thirds to date most of the risks both technical and related to the human factor - are behind. Of course, we understand that there is always a small risk of delays, but we promise to do our best and keep you informed. Now, that we are approaching to the last phase of our game's development, we are trying very hard to localize Legend of Persia into FIGS to support non-English speaking fans. Therefore finding the right talent to translate and voice-act the game's English scripts into meaningful, fun, yet epic in FIGS could be challenging. And that is where we could definitely benefit from your kind support.
