Money is needed to purchase Matterport 3D Camera and editing service.Along with aerial photography and video, the 3D camera system will be used to offer photography services to Real Estate agents in Central Arkansas. The fees collected from real estate photography services will help fund the project of documenting historical buildings using aerial phtography and video along with 3D interior photography and video. This project would begin in Central Arkansas and expand to other areas of the state. Traveling throughout the country documenting historical buildings in this way is the ultimate goal. Risks and challenges I believe once the 3D camera equipment is purchased, there is really not much risk at all in completing this project. I already have the drone for all the aerial photography and video and will obtain the necessary FAA certification for commercial drone use in August when the new rules go into effect. Since this is basically a one man operation, there are not other people involved to mess up the project. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
