New songs, new ideas, new energy... let's co-create some tunes together!Since the release of my 2010 project, TYRANENA, I've written lots of songs and had the chance to perform them live in my favorite coffeehouses venues. Now, in 2012, it feels like the right time to assemble some of them together in a new collection, to be released at the end of the summer."Dream Vessel" (featured in the Kickstarter video) is one of my favorites.Here's a demo of "Carry," which is also going to be included on the new album. Written in honor of Kory & Erin :) Because my label, Brave Records, offers digital distribution, and I'm lucky enough to have talented friends and collaborators who will help keep production and manufacturing costs down (including limited edition CDs), the estimated cost for this project is $2,500.YOU CAN HELP!-Want to contribute to planning the song order and selection?-Want to assist with the cover art?-Want to help name the album?-Want a song written for, or dedicated to you?Let's get started....Choose a support category that fits for you, and/or send supportive energy! Stay tuned for updates, including live performances of the new songs.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU :)
