The Battle of Okinawa proved to be a colossal military defeat for Japan -- one of its worst of the entirety of World War II. Well over 100,000 Japanese troops were killed, with another 7,000 taken as prisoners of war. Japanese aircraft losses totaled over 4,000. Despite their victory, the American forces suffered substantial losses: on land and at sea together, over 12,000 Americans were killed and over 36,000 wounded. 36 American ships and nearly 800 aircraft were also destroyed. Super: Over 120,000 Okinawan civilians perished. Risks and challenges We are attempting to start Development of Okinawa in September 2015. We are not currently with a Co-production company as of yet. Our main goal is to secure all development paperwork to secure a Co-production company to partner with. We do not know just when this will take place but we will try our best to go to the next level and produce this project to the world. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
