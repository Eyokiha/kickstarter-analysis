Over this past christmas I finally got an awesome 3200 Nikon camera and two good lenses. I am now hoping to expanding my skills as a photographer, while also expanding my knowledge as a Historian. The duration of this once in a life time experience, is 2 weeks. Your generous funding will go towards helping me with food and place to stay while there; the ability of transportation to, from, and around Italy; also, I would love to use any extra funds towards possible surprise gifts for the people who help make this dream a reality. Full discloser: I will not be travelling solo, my fiance will be accompanying me as I travel across the world. Because of this reason, the trip will also double as our honeymoon. However, your funding will only go toward the above mentioned things. Any extra expenses, not related, will be handled seperately.The main places I will stop (among others) during my travels include:Rome - The Vatican, The Colusseum, Underground Cities; Pompeii; Naples; Florence; Pisa - The Leaning Tower of Pisa; Venice; Verona; Milan.Feel free to request places or things that you would like me to photograph. Risks and challenges I have already aquired Rosetta Stone in Italian, so travelling in Italy will not be hindered by language. I have also discovered student train passes, so that I can cut travel prices to the lowest. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
