From September 24 until October 10 of this year, Arcturus Theater Company will present Marilyn Ansevin Austin's play, The Point, showing the effect a woman’s succumbing to dementia has on her family and friends, and the way they attempt to help her situation. It is our entry in DC’s citywide Women’s Voices Theater Festival, showcasing world-premiere works by women playwrights. We are a 501(c)(3) organization so your donation will be tax-deductible. Now in our fourth year, this will be our seventh show, to be presented at the Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church in DC. The cast includes Margeaux Martine, Jean H. Miller, Samuel Repshas, Kim Curtis, Cristen Stephansky, and Seth Rosenke. Music composed by Evan J. Dice, scenic and properties design by Lisa Marie Thalhammer, sound and lighting design by J. Michael Whalen, sound and lighting operation by Will Hawkins, graphic design by Jasen Hengst, and directed by Ross Heath. The cost of renting the venue, where we will also rehearse, is $2250. Cost of set and properties design and labor is $1000. The five principal actors get $500 apiece, another actor gets $100. Risks and challenges A risk is that we may have small turnout for this show. We are working to get the word out about to those who may be interested in seeing it, especially followers of Arcturus and those who may have an interest in seeing good theater, especially that covering the topic of dementia. Another risk is that a participant in the show may be unexpectedly unavailable during one of the performances. Adding funding would allow us to hire an understudy for the principal part, played by Margeaux Martine. Another risk is that someone involved in the show will be injured in the preparation or performance process. Arcturus is in the process of setting up insurance policies to protect the troupe and audiences. We expect the cost of the policies to be priced at least $1000.
