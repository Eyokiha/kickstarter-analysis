How We Sung the Blues is a short film about a young man and his family's experience at the wedding of someone with whom they have shared a traumatic experience. It will attempt to focus on both romantic and familial love and shine a light on their roles in our basic wellbeing. It will also try to explore the manners in which we face our demons and the affects of those confrontations. The film will feature the gorgeous Montana landscape that we have been lucky enough to have been provided and will showcase the talents of Montana actors and actresses.The music for the movie will be drawn from our community and each musician will be compensated for their work on the scoring of the film.This movie will showcase the great talents of the students of Media Arts at the University of Montana and, for their generous support, time, and energy, we hope to provide them with a movie they will be proud to have worked on. The movie will be shot in roughly five days in the middle of May and will premiere in the fall of 2013. Risks and challenges As with any film, we expect some obstacles to arise. How we are able to function as a unit and overcome said obstacles, however, is what makes our team strong. The major challenges of this particular film are in finding locations, props, and costumes, as well as the challenges that are typically faced with film making, such as functionality of equipment, cooperation of weather, and the preparation of our actors and crew. However, our crew of well trained and practiced students are fully aware of such challenges and have been trained to overcome them and better themselves in the process.
