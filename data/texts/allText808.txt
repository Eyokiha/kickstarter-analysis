The purpose of this project is to complete the Apple Tree Leaf Foundation Website. The mission of Apple Tree Leaf is to provide gifts to people who are suffering from cancer. For example, the video attached is my daughter requesting electronic devices to give to pediatric oncology wards. Also,we have given gift cards to moms who want a day at the spa when they are feeling their worst. One mom, Vanessa, used her gift card to buy clothes for her daughters because that's what made her feel better about herself and situation. Other goals include providing gas money, lodging assistance, and food while away from home. The website is a professional link advocating our cause. Every strong business needs to support their entity through a viable website. For this reason, we are reaching out to the Kickstarter community to help this project be a success. To quote Booker T. Washington, "If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else." Thank you for your help. Risks and challenges We have not been able to actively advertise our foundation since the website is not complete. Should this continue to be our obstacle, we will persevere by word of mouth and reaching out to local, community activists. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
