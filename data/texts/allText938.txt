Risks and challenges We are fully dedicated to launching our website and are very close to reaching our goals. The remaining funds will be used to help speed up our final design and developments. Obstacles: 1. Third party integrations. For example: third party integrations for credit checks. These are companies that will process requests, not handled directly by Rental Tree. 2.
