Although my friend Steve and I are teachers, we realize that we will always be lifelong students. One year ago, we set up www.thebandmasters.com. This project is two-fold. First: Steve and I sit down and pick the brains of some of the top players in the field of music education. We dig deep and ask questions about teaching techniques, avoiding burnout, and artistry. Second: we record the whole conversation, post it as a podcast, and release it for free for any educators that want to also participate in some unofficial professional development. We didn't know if there would be interest, but we decided that we would still do it, as it would be helpful to us. After five episodes that have each averaged 1,000 downloads, we believe that there is a demand!We love what we do, and the podcast will always be free. We also do what we can to keep costs down. I edit the podcast myself, and use a free software to do so. However, we have some unavoidable costs. Microphones and mixers. Web hosting monthly fees. Bandwith fees. Travel expenses. Your financial backing can help make this project better. We can obtain equipment to interview music educators outside of Illinois, in high audio quality. We can upgrade equipment to produce better quality podcasts. We can cover web hosting fees, and increase the amount of storage we have to house all of the recordings we plan to post. We're passionate about the project, and doing what we can to serve the profession of music education, including music students, teachers, and supporters. Risks and challenges There are thousands of music teachers, and there are students that will always need to be taught. We don't anticipate any setbacks or complications, as we're very lucky to be in a great field full of people that always want to help. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
