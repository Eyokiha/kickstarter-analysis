For any inquiries please contact: nophone.eu@gmail.com Risks and challenges One potential challenge is that development could take longer than expected. To guard against this, we've intentionally set a generous timeline for the development stage of the process based on where we currently stand. We hope we'll finish sooner, but we want to allow plenty of time in case it's needed. In all of this, we'll communicate often and clearly with our backers on where we are in the development and delivery process. We'll also be here to answer any questions you have about how things are going. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
