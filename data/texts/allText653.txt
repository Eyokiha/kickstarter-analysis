This product is a cheap remote light switch control for any room with a light switch. The shipped final product will be encased in a white plastic housing that you replace your current light switch cover with. Then all you will need to do is program a programmable TV remote to the Sony code, and then press a sequence of numbers, (like 1 2 3 1) to turn on light switch one. There will be directions on what numbers to press so the lights turn on and off depending on your package. This video shows the initial prototype module of the light switch controller, controlled by any programmable TV remote that can be programmed to the standard Sony TV code. The package will be much smaller that the photo, and video, once funded.(does not come with 9v battery, but I would recommend buying a rechargeable 9v battery with a charging kit at a local store.) Risks and challenges I have a degree in robotics, so this is a very simple project. There really is no challenge since I have already programmed and made the device. It would just be time consuming to create hundreds of housings for everyone with 3D Printers. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
