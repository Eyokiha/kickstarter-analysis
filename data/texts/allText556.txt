The Idea:The process of becoming inspired differs drastically depending on the person. Luckily, inspiration is usually derived from stress.During one of my classes, I had a vision, much like the rendering shown in the video. I knew that I had to make it a reality, except rather than create a still photograph, I felt that only a film could get my message across.The message I am trying to convey is one that really resonates with the experiences I have encountered throughout my life. In this beautiful film about the daily lives of ordinary people, the film Lena explores the juxtaposition between the ever seemingly perfect world we live in and the truth that lies beneath the surface. Budget:I have been going over the numbers, trying to figure out what would be an adequate amount for this film. Recently, I have received confirmation that my permit for filming has been approved and this has caused a large amount of momentum. After speaking with my production company, sound designers, and producers, I feel that by achieving my goal of $5,000, I will be able to produce a piece of art, which will speak to everyone who watches it and leave a lasting impression. I will be keeping everyone up to date on the process and right now we are scheduled to begin filming on May 5, 2014. Here are some preview clips from the storyboard: Thank you for your support! Risks and challenges As I mentioned in the short interview, one of the biggest challenges is making sure that the crew I assemble is professional and well-trained. I have a vision, and it is my job to make sure that it translates to film. To overcome this, I have been doing extensive interviews with as many candidates for positions as possible, and I feel that the crew is coming together very well. With the added funds from Kickstarter, I will be able to hire the necessary men and women who will boost this film to the next level. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
