Why im here?I've long awaited the opportunity to create my own, personal EP.Which will consist of piano instrumentals, mainly classical but not exluding blues and jazz of course.The Funding will go towards -- Recording, Mixing, and Mastering the Album in the Studio -Album Photography, Artwork and Design I've already put in a lot of my own pounds to hopefully make this happen, just need some much appreciated support.Where im at in the process...The music itself started to piece together several years ago now, then after being tinkered with over the years and much improved, with funding being little by little a smaller barrier to overcome each day, i feel myself nearing the finish, and with as much support as you're willing to give it will consistently fuel this project towards my life ambition. What's in it for you?well, of course you will receive a digital copy of the EP, my eternal appreciation and good vibes, no matter the size of the pledge. Besides the obvious, once funding is complete, I've ensured the chance for pledges of 20+ the opportunity to receive an original signed vinyl of my personal favorite concerto pieces. n Risks and challenges I don't foresee any obstacles, the music has been created, the recording studio is booked, and the rest relies on the amount of support received, Many thanks in advance.
