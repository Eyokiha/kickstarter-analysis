Democratize 3D CreativityNow that 3D printers are widely available, we all face the problem of how to make interesting models to print. Subdivisional modeling has been used for years by movie, game and toy designers to quickly produce high quality organic shapes. This project aims to bring that technology to everyone in their web browser.There are numerous 3D content creation apps on the market (Maya, 3D Studio, Freeform, Mud Box, Z-Brush) costing from $400 to $20,000. There are also a few open source apps (Blender, Silo etc) which are free but hard to use. Here's an example of what you can do with this technology shown in an existing desktop product - head demo. This project will make this type of subdivisional modeling available in your web browser and cost less than $30 a month. There will even be a free version with all the features of the pro version but limited to small models.For more serious users, there will be collaborative editing and workgroup support.With the advent of Autodesk Fusion and Onshape, CAD software is moving to the web - it's time 3D artistic software made the move as well. Risks and challenges 3D Models of this sort are data intensive sometimes involving millions of polygons (facets of the model). It will be a challenge to get adequate performance out of a web browser based modeler. Onshape has shown this is can be done for CAD models, there is a risk it cannot be done for subdivisional models. It's unclear how much market there is for this type of product. From previous experience most people can learn subdivisional modeling fairly quickly, enjoy the experience and can make attractive models. There is a risk people will not be attracted to the product. There are several technical risks in the area web deployment, scalability, security etc. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
