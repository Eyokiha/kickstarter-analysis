Cooking for the last 10 years I, just like many cooks, developed a callus on my lower forefinger. At first it was a badge i earned by doing what I love...but after Long sessions of cutting and slicing it has become a discomfort. My invention was designed to take out those 90 degree angles of cold hard steel. It can fit a range of knife sizes and will have multiple versions based on other knife sizes. Easy to attach and remove, swap and customize colors to your favorite knife handle. I just hope I can bring the Comfort and Relief I have brought myself. Risks and challenges Hardly much of a risk with the drive I have. It's mainly raising enough to start producing and create packaging to send out. My dream is to see them on counters in cutlery stores across the Country and one day beyond that. Possibly even design a custom case to keep them collected. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
