Hey there! My name is Isaac, hopeful owner of Void Photography! I'd like to start off by thanking you for even coming to my campaign page. It means the world to me that word is getting out about what I want to do with this opportunity. My passion is photography. Well, it's on of my passions I should say. Even before I came to college I've had dreams of travelling the world taking photos of every experience and amazing wonder I found myself encountering. With all my dreams and passion supporting me, I've decided that, while I appreciate learning and everything it brings, I'd like to embrace a life of travel and photography. It's always been an unspoken passion of mine, and whenever someone commented on how well a certain photo was taken without knowing I was behind it, I always got a little giddy inside. I know I have a talent that I would like to expand upon with more training and more opportunities, but the only way anyone can do anything is with funds. So, here I am empty handed and hungry for my next taste of adventure, wanting to escape the clutches of an inevitable 9-5 job, and willing to do whatever it takes to deliver on every promise I set before you. I want you, the Backer, to challenge me in this venture and give me this incentive to be the best I can be. I want to work as hard as I possibly can to make whatever donation you choose to make worth it. Any and all photos posted are my own original content. They will start to diversify once the opportunity arises. Risks and challenges In the event that my goal is met and I do get everything that's required, the most obvious challenge would be the amount of networking that would still have to be done to lift off something as specific as a photography business. The risks would include an immediate fall in income, a slow rise in costs, a lack of funds to go to more diverse destinations, and so on. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
