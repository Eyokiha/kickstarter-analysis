Hi! My name is Robin Andersson and I'am 27 years old. I have been working on music since 2005 , on and off with a friend but it never became so serious that we released anything. We focused on electronic dance music but I also started to learn how to sing, In 2013 my dear friend got the news that he had a brain tumor and started out the treatment to get healty again. After he got the news it want a couple of weeks and he said the after almost ten years of making music, and getting the news of his brain tumor he didnt now when life would end.So we decided to make it serious , make an album called Randomize with diffrent styles of music . From Electronic dance music, to rnb and some hiphop.Unfortunately we only made ONE full track before we tumor got worse and he past away earlier this year. So we got the chance to relase one single.So now I have decied to start up the album again and finish it in is honour.But I need your help to make this come to reality.I don't have the money for studiotime, get vocalist and mastering the album and such things. So now i turn to this page and hoping someone will help me!Sincerly / Robin Andersson Risks and challenges To get contact with singers in time to deadline. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
