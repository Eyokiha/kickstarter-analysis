About the FilmIf I Did It is inspired by a true story. In the ever freezing Los Angeles winter of 2009, Kelle Leonard, co-writer and director, was wrongfully accused of stealing the baby Jesus from the City of Orange's nativity scene. After being grilled by OPD detectives, Kelle made it his goal to turn the events into a film. If I Did It was born.The film follows the alcoholic mayor of a small town, as he descends into madness when he realizes that he is responsible for the disappearance of the baby Jesus.The film was co-written by Daniel Crooke, a Junior, Screenwriting major at Chapman University, and Kelle Leonard. Kelle will also direct.How We Will Do ItIf I Did It will be shot on Super 16mm film over three days at the beginning of November, and will premiere in mid-December. The completed film will run ten minutes.With a current budget of $1,000, the film will shoot locally with a modest, but hardworking, crew, and as much camera and lighting equipment as we can get our hands on.What the Money is ForWe hope to raise an additional $500, through this campaign, to help with location and permit costs, additional lighting and camera equipment rentals, as well as, provide a great spread of food for our hardworking crew. Funds will also be used to cover post-production costs to take the film from camera to editing.Any pledge, no matter the size, is greatly appreciated. If you take a look at the rewards, you will see that we have some awesome items to show our appreciation, starting at just $5. The best part about the whole Kickstarter campaign is that you will not be charged until the campaign ends and we reach our funding goal.
