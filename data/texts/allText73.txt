The Living Wyoming Project is committed to publishing the most in-depth series of photographic & informational books ever presented on the state of Wyoming. Our first book will cover the Southeastern Quadrant of the state. One of our main goals is to show areas that most people will never have an opportunity to see. “Off the beaten path” comes close to describing what we’re trying to accomplish. We have funded the trips we’ve already made to S.E. Wyoming through donations, sponsorships & out of pocket monies. Our target with this Kickstarter project is to take all the research, mapping, driving & hiking as well as the more than 15,000 images we’ve taken, and put our first hardcover book in print. The amount of funding we’re trying to achieve is to cover the cost of printing & shipping 1,000 high quality copies. Risks and challenges Our biggest challenge will be trimming down the more than 15,000 images we've taken, to the approximately 120 to 125 that will actually appear in the book. The time involved in narrowing the field could potentially push back our anticipated publication date - but we're totally committed to presenting the very best images we possibly can. We do plan to keep all contributors updated if any delays look unavoidable. Ultimately, we are firm in our commitment to publish a book that will leave everyone excited to hear when our next book - covering the Northeast Quadrant - will be available.
