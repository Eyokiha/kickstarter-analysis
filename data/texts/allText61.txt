More than just HollywoodThe City of Los Angeles is famous Hollywood's glitz and glamour, as well as sandy beaches, warm weather, and an active nightlife. Every year, millions from across the globe come to the city to explore what LA has to offer. In other words, it is one of the top tourist destinations around the world. However, with an overwhelming area of over 500 square miles, some local businesses and tourist spots tend to be left out of the scene.Summer is coming, and more tourists from all over the world are expected to flock the city. For many residents, particularly students, it is time for summer vacation. The "usual" tourist spots such as Venice, Miracle Mile, and Hollywood are the top choices for places to have a good time. Don't, however, limit yourself on those destinations. at over 500 square miles, there's gotta be a million places for you to unwind.This summer, I plan on going around the city to showcase some of the popular and some of the undiscovered spots in LA, where one can find a good time. I will be posting these spots in a blog with a goal of at least one post per week. Depending on how much I raise, this may continue for a few more months into fall. So if you have a business you think is worth discovering, now is your chance to be discovered!The reason I need a little bit of funding is because I need a few upgrades for my equipment, and some of the spots I plan to visit will not be free. I believe that my set goal is enough for the small upgrade that will make a huge difference in the result of the photographs. Risks and challenges I am not one of the best photographers out there. I may end up taking over 1000 photos with only 5-10 being worthy enough for the showcase. However, with this being an opportunity for me to practice, I may just end up with more than 20 good photos to feature. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
