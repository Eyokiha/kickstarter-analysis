I'm looking to do a Paranormal Investigation of Australia's Largest Abandoned Lunatic Asylum, Aradale. It has only been opened to the public in the last few years and I am aiming to do a full walk-through of the asylum filming and taking photo's as I go.The main goal of this photo shoot will be to try and capture evidence of ghosts or spirits on camera.The Asylum is located near Ararat Victoria about an hours drive from Ballarat.This would be my first time going to such a large and expansive place for such an investigation and I need to get some more specialized equipment and camera's for the project, hence my appeal to you lovely people on kick starter.Once I have completed the project and put everything together the results will be uploaded and available to everyone who is interested. Risks and challenges The main challenge I have in completing this Project will be obtaining the funding for the purchase of some new specialized equipment. All other arrangements such as travel and accommodation and location costs I have arranged already, but to get the most out of this trip I could use some better gear. The only setback after this project has been funded would be due to weather or the Asylum staff needing to delay the project. Both of which would be short term delays.
