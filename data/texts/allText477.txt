Green County is a TV Pilot with the intent to humanize the idea of the legalization of marijuana. We are sophisticating legalization with the comedy/drama, and need your help! I'm funding this entire thing out of pocket, we have all of our permits & equipment secured, we just need the support of you, the people! With the connections Green County's creator has established throughout his time in the industry, Green County has the potential to be one of the defining programs of our generation; join us in our journey to change the world! Risks and challenges With every project comes risks, such as: production delays, financing, etc. I, in collaboration with the Ohio Center For Broadcasting have back up equipment if something goes ary (cameras, lights, boom mics, etc.) and my staff is majority interns working their butts off for the experience & opportunity to be a part of something special.
