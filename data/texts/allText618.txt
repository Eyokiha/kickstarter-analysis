Hey beautiful people, My name is Tyron and I think I have found the best app which helps you to create the perfect event adding in the venue, time, where, details, dates and much more.After creating the event, you will be asked to send out invitations to whoever you want to come. You can email them, Facebook them or if they have their own account on the app, invite them on the app if you wish. This will help friends of any age to meet-up at a bar, create a party, go watch a movie with friends or even just a little house warming or get-together at a chosen house.Events are endless and help to quickly and easily send an event invitation to the right people ensuring that no one else knows about the event except for the recipients invited. I have a lot of faith in this becoming a huge and successful app.I currently have no projects that I am working on right now so i can solely focus and give all my time to this. I will also be dealing with an outsource company to create my app for me to make it the best app it can possibly be.Thank youTyronRM2014 Copyright (c) Tyron Riedler-MugridgeThe app is not guaranteed success. Risks and challenges Challenges: The app may take between 1-4 months to be fully complete and ready for download in the app store but I am extremely determined. Risks: The app is not guaranteed success to bare that in mind, although I have extremely high hopes and expectations. After all, I am a perfectionist. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
