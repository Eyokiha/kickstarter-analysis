Risks and challenges The main challenge that comes with building a community is that no one will join. I can overcome this challenge by posting on every gaming community and facebook page about my community to gain members. Other challenges are coding in a language you don't understand. I will be coding in HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. I know how to code HTML and CSS but PHP and JS I am still learning. I will be using a localhost to make sure I don't mess up anything on the live site. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
