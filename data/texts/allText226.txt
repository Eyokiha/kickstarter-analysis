My name is Nick Berry and I am a Country Singer/Songwriter currently living in California, although I record my music in Nashville, TN.After a lot of convincing and encouragement, I am finally taking a leap of faith and working on putting out a debut album of my music. If you're not familiar with any of my tunes, I invite you to visit my Website, www.take38music.com, and take a listen. I also have a couple of tunes up on iTunes. Or better yet...take a listen to my song, "Without You With Me" right here on my Kickstarter page. Right now I have four of ten songs recorded, and would like to be able to get back into the studio and record the remaining six to put on the album and have it out for release by the Spring of 2014. I don't work with a label, so I'm doing this all on my own with no real financial backing. That's where this Kickstarter project comes in.I'm hoping that by putting myself out there and letting everyone know what I'm trying to do, that people will be willing to support the project. If you're a fan of Country music, then I hope I can bring you some songs that you'll enjoy listening to over and over. And share with your friends. Risks and challenges If things go well, I am hoping to have my album completed by Spring, 2014. If I don't reach my goals, then it will take longer, as I will be fully funding the project myself, but it will get done. Just later than I would have liked. I've had a number of people encouraging me to put an album of my songs out and this is a huge risk for me, in terms of approaching total strangers and asking for support. I wouldn't do it if I didn't believe that I could pull it off. I'm almost halfway done already, so I know going in and recording these remaining six songs is within my grasp.
