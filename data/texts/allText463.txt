"Unlocked" (Working Title) is a digital series that is focused on gaming culture. Far too often gaming is represented either negatively or falsely in the entertainment industry. We want to change that notion and offer viewers something that they can relate to and enjoy. This comedic series would span ten episodes and focus on the main character, Edge. He attends a prestigious university, but due to forces beyond his control he loses his scholarship. Now, to continue school he has to put his skills to the test and win the ultimate gaming competition. Expect plenty of gaming jokes and references throughout the show. Can you catch them all? We would also like to expand the world of the show in order to fully engross viewers in the world the show presents. Expect to see plenty of extra content appear on our website such as contest, behind-the-scenes, and mini-shows. We have already arranged for the series to be shown on an established platform, but now we need your help to get it off the ground. You gracious donations would go towards funding the production design, equipment rental, and other various expenses required to provide the highest quality show possible. Every dollar helps and hopefully we have offered some great rewards, as well. We love games and we want to make something that others who love games will enjoy. With your help this will never happen again. -Brandon
