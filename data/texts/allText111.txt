We've been travelling New Zealand for the past year while living in our van. It's been an opportunity to show case some of our moments by photos, video & blog posts. Being that we won't be coming home for Christmas this season, we wanted to give back our experiences during this New Zealand adventure of ours with a photo of your choosing from our assortment of pictures from Palooza Pics (you're also welcome to select any picture we've already featured on Live4TheRush as an option). Let us know in the comments section which photo(s) you would like (each have a # above to make things easier). If you have no photo preference, we will pick for you :)The funds we raise will go towards some necessary mechanical upgrades to our van / home. The clutch has recently grown tired and needs replacing sooner than later. Any other remaining funds after repairing our van will go towards upgrading our gear for the adventures we set out on a regular basis. Safety is always on our mind and one thing is particular has been on our mind to get - a personal locator beacon. In the event of an emergency in the backcountry this would be a very valuable tool to have.Besides the beacon.. things are always wearing out and instead of sending objects to New Zealand and spending all your money on freight, we figured it would be simpler to exchange money for some of the amazing memories we have been so lucky to experience.This Kickstarter will also be a chance to spread the Live4TheRush and Palooza Pics names around, potentially turning them into something more than just a hobby.From our home to yours, Merry Christmas!- Mitch & Marisa Risks and challenges Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. - T.
