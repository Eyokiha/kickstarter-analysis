I am working today on my new project, an edition called "Ours". I've started it 6 month ago and I'd like to realize an edition with my photographs and perhaps an exhibition. I'd need to rent some material, to print and bind the book. I'd limit the first edition to 200 copies approximately plus some extras prints.I called my project "Ours" because I want people to feel concern by my pictures, I want them to recognize their cities and streets, I want people to feel the connection with their place and places they've been to. Except Switzerland, I have already been to Russia and Eastern Europe, I'd like to go further and have as many places to photograph as I can. Next trip Kosovo.No place is mine or yours or theirs, it is all ours. Risks and challenges road accident Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
