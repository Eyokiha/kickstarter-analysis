This project came about from my years of working as an automated garbage truck driver in rural towns. I noticed that there were a lot of waste wheelers being knocked over from the wind as well as racoons and other small animals on trash day making a huge mess that the customer or I would have to pick up. I decided I had to think of something that would cut down on the times this happened and the amount of mess that was being created. I scoured the interenet and came up with no device that would accomplish this for automated trucks, although there are devices for manual opening, there is nothing for automated pickup. the S.A.D.L. will open automatically once the automated truck has lifted it into the emptying position, which is approximately a 45 degree angle upside down. Two years into the thought process has come up with the current design that I am getting ready to drop into production. The funding is for tools, materials and production costs to produce this item. The S.A.D.L. is made in one size and will fit on 99 percent of all current waste wheelers in production. This item is currently protected by a patent. Risks and challenges Once funding is complete the S.A.D.L. will be put into production and will be shipped out as soon as each one is completed. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
