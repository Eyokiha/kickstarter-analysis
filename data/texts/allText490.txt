Our film crew Duhck Squad wants to produce one final movie. We are students who are a few months out from graduating and want prove our full potential in our class: Movie Production Advanced Cinema. With a set budget, we will fund our new upcoming Thriller/Action/Drama film about a bank heist. With our story nearly fully written and planned out, we would be tremendously helped if we raise enough money for props, gear, permits and essential supplies. Our many amateur short films on our Youtube channel "Yourface177" have all been conducted with bare minimum resources and no budget money. The plan is to strategically spend the raised money on what we need to make our next movie more professional grade. Any amount would be an amazing help! Risks and challenges The main risk is not being able to assemble necessary props and gear for the quality of this film. For our bank heist movie, here are some of the pieces we need funding for: -Law enforcement character props, outfits, gear etc. -Stunt car, equipment funding. -Permit costs -Pyrotechnic(s) -Practical effect gear (smoke, powder, projectors etc) -Prop weapons -Wardrobe for all other characters (bank robbers) -Set design funds (bank) -Select actor payroll -Transportation to various sites Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
