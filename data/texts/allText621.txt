I started this project when I went through my first experience developing mobile apps only a year ago, and realized there was a definite need to streamline the process and get developers writing code faster, and since time is money, if a developer is putting that time into setting up their environment for each project, not much is getting done... I am now able to successfully run some scripts through Java & batch files to reduce that time down to mere seconds, approximately 9 seconds to do a complete build and get an APK in hand and ready to upload to the marketplace...which leads me to the reasoning for this sort of app in the first place-Ever have a great idea for an app? Like many, the answer is probably Yes- Unfortunately the real-world process of getting up to the point of focusing on developing the app itself can be daunting and not very forgiving if you've done something wrong. If you have some know-how, or maybe hold some JavaScript ninja-skills, you have probably already taken a stab at developing an Android app and getting it on the marketplace. You may have also then quickly realized its not simply uploading a simple html or .js code on the marketplace...if you were even more dedicated and weren't dissuaded by the mind-blowing all day event of simply trying to compile your first hello-world apk, signed and ready to go, then you may have even given up when you realize you'd have to go through that same process a couple more times just to start fresh and upload a new app.Not to worry, Android and Cordova both have great, and lengthly, documentation and developers across the net available to help in getting folks up and running in a few hours....but wouldn't it be nice to just open up a simple GUI, and do a point and click to generate a new app project, already configured, then also be able to click something like "Build Release", and be able to upload your file...all that in under a minute*? and be able to continue development in your favorite IDE- Sure beats the command line process through cordova (CLI).The goal of this project is simple and straightforward, produce an application that gets developers and coders everywhere focused on the logic of the app, and not the setup or packaging- which will be taken care of through a simple and usable interface, the application can run on windows, linux, and mac. Risks and challenges I'm a full time software engineer with years of experience and a great community of fellow computer scientists who love to jump in and help with apps whenever possible, the only limitation is the computer the app will sit on for users, which once fully tested won't really be limited. To overcome any glitches or bugs, I am also reaching out to some of my family, friends, and the backers here at kickstarter to get testing and feedback right from the start.
