The Holy land is best experienced in person however we know that not everyone will have the opportunity to visit Israel first hand. In 2010 we had the great blessing to be there for 11 days. I was also blessed to have the time, ability and equipment to take over 3500 of the most breathtaking photos ever. My desire is that these photos to be viewed by everyone that desires to see and learn more about the Holy Land. These are High definition photos with an extensive detailed description of each site that are sure to inspire the spiritual being inside each of us.With all the unrest and instability currently in the region it is imperative that we do our best to share the beauty and rich history that is the Holy Land.It doesn't matter if you are Jewish, Christian or Muslim, these photos depict the beauty, history, and greatness that is The Holy Landâ€¦. Risks and challenges There are no risk or challenges. I personally took each of the photos and have all copyright to them. We have a printer lined up and ready to fulfill our needs in every aspect from layout to printing. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
