The Squad is the story about a young girls dream to be on the high school cheerleading squad that takes a morbid turn. After her initial try out, her family gets brutally Murdered. Years Later, She is the Cheerleading coach. Many murders and Many lies...all will unfold in front of our eyes. The Squad will star actors Trent Haaga, Edwin Neal, and also myself (Robyn Griggs). Many others to be announced as well. . This will be shot this summer in Ohio, I plan on using a very experienced DP and would like to do this film with the feeling as such movies as the original Prom Night and Halloween. Spooky, creepy, but not over the Top. I will be having some surprise cameos as well. I always am in front of the camera, which I love, but for once I want to be behind the camera too. I am going to give it a shot. I don't expect an Oscar, but I do want to do justice to The Horror Genre. Thanks for helping me make a dream come true :) www.robyngriggs.net
