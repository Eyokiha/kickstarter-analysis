Shipping Note: Shipping rates are based on USPS Priority Mail flat rate packages. Risks and challenges While we have come really far in creating Switcheroo and have fully functional hand-made units, there are some final steps that we will need to take to get this product into your hands. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible about any issues or delays that come up as we prepare Switcheroo for mass production. We plan to communicate actively to keep backers like you on top of our progress. Regulatory We plan to submit Switcheroo's final design for FCC and safety (UL or similar) approval shortly, and have designed the product with these standards in mind. Manufacturing/Sourcing We have several manufacturing options lined up, but will make our final selection partially based on the size of the initial order (which is impacted by the success of this campaign). Availability of components can sometimes cause delays, which we account for by building realistic timelines into our project plans, using the mantra of "plan for the worst and hope for the best."
