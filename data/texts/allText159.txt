https://theoriginalmagic.bandcamp.com/I'm a music producer who has been writing songs since I could belt 'em out, and obsessed with recording since I discovered my dad's tape recorders. Stylistically I'm all over the map, but one of a kind. Please give a listen over on my Bandcamp page, and if you like what you hear, consider supporting my next release. I've never done this "asking for help online" thing, but was inspired by reading Amanda Palmer's "The Art of Asking". I'm an unemployed designer at the moment and struggling to make my way. I'm hoping enough people like my music to support me in continuing to make it. Risks and challenges There are no risks. As a creative process, I have done this hundreds of times. I merely need to "clear the decks" of all other obligations to make it happen. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
