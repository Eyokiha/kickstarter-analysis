In the short film, Tableau, my main character, JT, is a filmmaker in a small town with big ideas about the future, the far-off future of the human race. He tries to pull together a professional crew to work with him on his Utopic SciFi film, but is thwarted, in part by his own ambitions. He finds an unlikely alliance with the neighborhood girls. At first the teens are antagonistic to this thoughtful auteur, but as they gain an understanding of his vision they become his three muses along with his own three toy poodles. At last his vision is realized! With Tableau I am able to combine my love of luscious and choreographed imagery and the quirkiness of everyday observation. This story is about the small parts of everyday and how they collect to make a fantastic mental picture of meaning and future. Much of the material is fictionalized stories stemming from my life and the life of my main actor, collaborator, neighbor and friend, Joshua Thorson. Joshua is a consummate artist in his own right. I'm very excited to work with a small, but extremely professional crew. My producer is Silas Howard, himself an accomplished director, and my director of photography is the masterful and prolific Ben Peyser. More info coming soon!
