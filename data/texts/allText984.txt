Many longtime locals have talked of performances, concerts, graduations at St. Columba's amphitheater in Inverness, California. It seems that all use of the area stopped in the early 70's. The grounds are overgrown and the stage has deteriorated to such a point that is currently unusable. In visiting the site, and speaking with the church, there is great potential and interest in renovating the long-abandoned spot and to revitalize this venue for this production as well as for future entertainments.This play, Much Ado About Nothing will be done under the auspices of the Actors' Equity Members' Project Code. It is required that it be actor-produced. Not being a theatre company, the budget must be locally and holistically sourced. Included in the budget is time and materials to build a simple platform stage, and to pay for required facilities rentals and shuttle services for performance dates.Thank you for reading this, and a very hopeful thank you for any kind of support! BTW - thanks to everyone who helped to put together this crazy fun video: Matt Gallagher for filming and Denise Eletich for editing - also the many many people I actually physically dragged in to take part: Lorenzo, Matt, Brandon, Zack, Georgina, Michelle, Meghan, various local children - Musicians Sanford and Loyal (playing Sanford's tuneful tune "Limantour") and actors Chloe and Michael! - and thank you lovely folks at St. Columba's for your enthusiasm and terrific support for this project! Risks and challenges It is a large undertaking to produce a fully-fledged theatre piece - but something I now have the experience of successfully doing. In May, I brought in many of this current creative team for my production of The Heiress at the Dance Palace Church Space. It was positively received - so much so, that I have a keen desire to try this bigger project - potentially helping to build the beginnings of another mutli-purpose performance venue in West Marin.
