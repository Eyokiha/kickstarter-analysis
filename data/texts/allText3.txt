Sitting around the dinner table last night, over a plate of spaghetti with homemade meat sauce, this project was born. We were eating this spaghetti sauce for the second time in a week and the comment was made, "Wow, this sauce tastes much better than the first time!" So I replied, "That's because the Italian spices that were added have mastized." Everyone at the table paused, shook their heads, and started laughing. "That's not a word!" they objected. And to that I say, 'Why NOT!'This Kickstarter campaign represents all the times we have searched for a suitable word to describe a situation, and nothing but sheer lexical creativity will do.My goal is to spend time to promote the word 'mastize' through blogs, video, music (hire a local band to write an original piece), posts, comments, etc. With enough usage and citations, Merriam-Webster will add this word to their dictionary. Risks and challenges Challenges: finding the right local band to write and record a song and possibly video to promote the word. I could use software to produce the song myself, but I'd love to have a real band help spread the word. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
