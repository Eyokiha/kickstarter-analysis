Award-winning short play "28 Years Later" is a semi-finalist in the Samuel French Off-off Broadway Short Play Festival. Out of 1400 submissions, it's one of 30 chosen to compete for publication by Samuel French. It's one night, and one night only (unless we make the finals; then it's two nights). Help this witty, loving homage to both horror movies and the horror of getting older put its best (shambling) foot forward at the Festival!Funds will be used to cover rental of rehearsal space, props, transportation reimbursement for the actors, stipend for the stage manager (because stage managers deserve it!) and other miscellaneous production costs. Risks and challenges We have produced "28 Years Later" before, and are confident in our ability to do it again successfully. The only challenge we can foresee is if, for some reason, we would need to soon mount the production yet again (let us have such problems!). In which case, we would start additional fundraising.
