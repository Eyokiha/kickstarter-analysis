You are reading about my project! Thank you so much! My name is Nora Jane Struthers and I am using this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to record my second, full length studio album. I am a Nashville based songwriter, singer, and full time touring musician. It's been two years since I released my debut studio record and I have so much new material that I want to share with you! I have already selected a group of songs that will be the foundation of this next album and I am thrilled to be working again with Grammy Award Winning Producer Brent Truitt. So where do you come in? I NEED YOUR HELP! I am trying to raise $20,000...in 30 days. All of the money I raise will go towards: RECORDING, EDITING & MIXING IN THE STUDIO - $12,000 PAYING THE MUSICIANS - $3,000 MASTERING THE CD - $500 GRAPHIC DESIGN - $800-$1,000 PACKAGING & DUPLICATION OF 1000 CDS - $1,500 KICKSTARTER AND AMAZON TOGETHER TAKE 10% - $2,000 TOTAL = $20,000 But here's the thing - it's an all or nothing effort... If I can't raise all of it, I get none of it! (in which case no one's credit card gets charged).Please check out the list of REWARDS on the right margin-->I hope you find something there that makes you want to be a part of making this record. If you do, don't wait! Donate now. :)And HELP spread the word about this project on all of your favorite social networking sites: FACEBOOK, TWITTER, THE BLOG-O-SPHERE, ETC...& TALK ABOUT IT IN REAL LIFE TOO! That might be the most powerful!If I meet my goal, I plan to record the album this October and release it in March/April of 2013. I've already got the studio time booked, I just need a little help to get in there. - - - - - - - - - - - Music is such a powerful thing. It’s been a powerful force in my life and it is my life’s ambition to create powerful music. Music that is connected to the past and pushing into the future. This group of songs, this record, is my chance to begin that journey. And if you can help me get started, I will be eternally grateful. Anything you can give, I promise to put to good use. As a recording musician and a performer, the music I make will only ever be as powerful as impact is has on the people who listen to it. Thank you for listening to my story and thank you for helping me spread the word about this project. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Photo by: Scott SimontacciThanks to my friends Dycee Wildman and Craig Hill for helping me make this Kickstarter video!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - You're still reading? Amazing! Thank you! I grew up playing and singing with my dad in northern New Jersey, of all places, just outside of New York City. My dad plays the banjo and the guitar and sings like a bird. He loves old country and folk, bluegrass and old-time, the Beatles and the Byrds, Bill Monroe and the Blue Sky Boys. All of that wonderful music was a big part of my childhood and I picked up the guitar when I was 14. My dad and I still play and sing together every chance we get. HERE WE ARE PLAYING IN MADISON SQ. PARK - NYC - OCTOBER 2011 THE HANDSOME GUY WITH THE BANJO IS MY DAD (P. J. George, Pat Falco, Nora Jane Struthers, Al Struthers, Rob Hecht)I attended New York University and got my degree in English Education. I landed a job teaching high school English at a charter school in Brooklyn. I worked really hard. I remember walking to school in when the moon was still high in the night sky. (If any of my ex-students are reading this, please post inspiring testimonials here, or on my FACEBOOK page.) In my third year of teaching I had a revelation: I was a successful New York workingwoman; I had achieved exactly what I’d been working towards and yet, I was not happy. I loved my students and I loved my job, but I had always wanted to be a musician and I just realized, if I’m ever going to go for it, I need to do it NOW. So I put in my notice, finished out the school year, then packed up my Honda Odyssey Minivan, and moved to Nashville. (Yes, it is cliche, but it is also the truth.) Over the next year, I wrote and recorded my first album, put together a great team of professionals to help me promote it... ...and hit the road with my band: Nora Jane Struthers & The Bootleggers THIS IS WHAT PURE JOY LOOKS LIKE Me &The Bootleggers right after we won the 2010 Telluride Band Competition! (P. J. George, Nora Jane Struthers, Ward Stout, and Dave Goldenberg)I love touring. I also love the amazing community of musicians I'm now a part of, both here in Nashville, and all over this great country. I am one hard-working, lucky girl. MUSIC MAKES PEOPLE HAPPY. PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS PROJECT TO ANYONE YOU THINK WOULD ENJOY MY MUSIC. IF THIS FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN SUCCEEDS, IT WILL BE BECAUSE A LOT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GIVE A LITTLE, AND A FEW ARE ABLE TO GIVE A LOT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
