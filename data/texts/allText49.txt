THIS KICKSTARTER WILL MAINLY FUND THE PRODUCTION OF POSTCARDS AND SOME UNFORESEEN TRAVEL EVENTS -- NOT OUR PLANE TICKET OR HOTELS! WE'VE ALREADY SAVED UP!I will be shooting a ton of pictures along the way from Paris to London and I'd love to share all the things I encounter and experience along the way with as many people as possible.I will be traveling with two of my closest friends, Abid and Shahmir. We created an Instagram (postcardsgoingsomewhere) that will allow you to see all of our photo updates and our previous travel pictures. We created this postcard project in response to everyone who wished they could come along. Our hope is that this will allow you to feel as if you've taken part in this special journey with us!All the postcards will be produced and sent as soon as we get back to the United States. We'll take a picture of something decidedly beautiful, post them onto our Instagram, and either send you a random print or send you a selected one of your choice. We've been saving up and planning for this trip -- we're ready to go October 3rd no matter what. We're doing the Kickstarter to cover the cost of a printing, paper, ink, and postage. It breaks down to $2 a postcard for a standard size. Check out our Instagram at Postcards Going Somewhere and don't forget to follow us for the most current updates on our journey. Here is what the postcards will look like. Standard Postcard Standard backside Oversized Postcard Oversized backside Jumbo sized Postcard Jumbo sized backside Risks and challenges The main challenge we see arising is having some set backs with the production of the postcards that could possibly delay the delivery date. If that problem does arise, we will update all the backers to keep them well informed on the progress. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
