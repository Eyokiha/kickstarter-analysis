This is a website that aggregates all the material a user has learned from online educational websites such as Khan Academy, Coursera, Udemy, etc. and posts it all on one page in a user profile. It is used for professional networking.This website will be somewhat similar to Linked-In in the sense that it is a resume website that attempts to match job-seekers to employers but differs in the sense that it is meant to disrupt the current marketplace where applicants apply based off of educational achievements online rather than traditional high school and college degrees. The company will officially be incorporated when the website that is built has gained a significant amount of traction.As quoted from Alan Greenspan, "Many employers report difficulty in hiring the job skills they need, and that concern is mirrored in the ratio of recent job openings to new hirings, which in March 2014 was as high as it was in 2007, a period when labor markets were far tighter and all categories of workers were in short supply. This suggests that the skill structure of the workforce overall does not match the needs implied by the complexity of our capital infrastructure, most specifically in areas of high-tech industry."Perhaps we could switch from a society where people go to company websites to apply for jobs to one where employers and prospective employees instead go to skillsexposed.com ( or whatever the name of the website will be) where the site plays the role of matchmaker. Risks and challenges The risks and challenges involved in developing and maintaining a website like this are the cost of the web hosting, the servers and the user base grows, and the talent that will be need from the engineers that will make the product.
