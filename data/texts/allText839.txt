I love my iPod projector! I watch movies on my wall in my room. I would like to build projectors for my friends and other people that want one. I make them myself with a shoebox and special magnifying glass. You simply put any iPod or iPhone into the holder, adjust the holder to focus, and watch your movie on a wall. you can project an image on your wall about 2ft wide. Pretty cool!I tried to take video of the projector showing a movie but it doesn't show up well on the video because the room is so dark. In a dark room the movie on your wall looks great!The great thing about my projector is it doesn't use any power. You simply put your iPod or iPhone in it and begin projecting images! I will test every projector to make sure it works and I will paint it black.Thanks for looking at my project!ps. My dog Lucy is not included.Liam Risks and challenges One of the challenges I will face is finding enough shoeboxes depending on how many people want a projector. Your shoebox may be a different size than the one in my video but I promise it will work! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
