A close friend and I have been shooting aerial video with Multi-rotors for a couple years now and have shot some really cool things, now we'd like to put our talents to good use. We would like to put together a promotional video or at least provide the raw footage so that the city can make their own promotional video for Riverfront park and the city. We both work at Huppins, a locally family owned electronics store that has been in Spokane since 1908, and have extensive knowledge regarding photography and have a strong background with piloting the multirotor crafts. We've both been part of free local photography classes regarding gopros and aerial photography for the community. If you've seen any of the commercials or promotional videos for the city you know that they are horribly outdated and poor quality, we would love to provide high definition material that might actually do the beauty of the park justice, offering cool new perspectives and angles. Risks and challenges The biggest hurdle we're going to face is cost, between the two of us we've invested over $5,000 in our current multirotors, and they are only capable of carrying gopro cameras, which while great, they are not professional level and the crafts aren't stable enough to provide a vibration free video. This has been a hobby for us thus far and we'd like to do something meaningful with it. Unfortunately, since it is a hobby, we haven't been able to raise enough money to build the type of rigs that we would need for a project like this. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
