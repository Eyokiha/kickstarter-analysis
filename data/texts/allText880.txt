To start this project I must say that I'm working in a restaurant as a bartender/waiter and I was working on many programs but non of them was good for more than just one thing. If booking programming it was a chore to operate it so we decided to stick to pen and paper. Ordering programming wasn't smatr enough so we had to add additional notes to the order afterwards anyway. Stock ccheck wasn't reliable and you had to remember a lot to keep track of everything. As you know that resolved in some mistakes here and there.So I decided to make my program for it. I have the knowlage (uni and all) and the practice in a restaurant to know what is needed and what's not.I want to make a programming that has the options you need for bookings, orders, stock chech, managing stuff shifts, statistics like average people and money made and so on. Every option is going to be implemented in a nice graphical sheet witch custom color for every one to choose from. My aim is to built it for touch screens and normal screens and well and tablets and smart phones. Lots and lots of work and tinkering with it but with your help I can dedicate myself to make it work perfect.If you ask wwhat's the money for well that will help me with a lot of things. First of all I need time for it and the money will help me take this timeSecondly I will speed up things when I can pay for help of a professional programmer :p (not that I can't do it its just going to speed things up working with someone) And the rest of the money? Well I need some hardware to test it properly at the end of the day so that costs. Risks and challenges Risk: it may take longer than I think. I estimate to finish it by may 2015.
