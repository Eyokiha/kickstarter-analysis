The StoryA Killing Day is a story about three people and the worst day of their lives. Vincent has just been released from prison for drug possession charges. He wants to start over, and his new girlfriend Beth is intent on helping him live a clean and quiet life. However, Vincent has one last score to settle: steal a bag full of cash from the person who set him up. To pull this off, Vincent recruits his ex-girlfriend, Holly, and together they hatch the perfect plan. The only thing they didn't count on was each other.BackgroundThis project has been in the works since 2009, but we were unable to proceed due to financial constraints, as well as obligations to other projects. Full of suspense and dark humor, A Killing Day also has some highly graphic sequences, and we knew that we'd need a sizable budget to make these scenes work. Kickstarter has now presented us with the opportunity to make our vision into a reality, and we're ready to make it happen.What's Kickstarter?Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects, where pledges can be made in return for certain rewards. Every project has a set number of days to raise the target funding amount, or the project receives nothing. In our case, we're aiming to raise $50,000 in 30 days. If we don't raise that amount in time, then we don't get a dime. What Will We Use the Money for?The money we raise will cover every expense of the film, from pre-production (casting, locations, etc.) to post-production (graphics, music licensing, etc.), as well as marketing expenses and film festival fees. We already have most of the elements for the film in place, and we plan to start shooting within 3 months of getting the funds. Ultimately, we just want to make a kick-ass film that will stand the test of time. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can also go to akillingday.com to track our progress, and learn more about the film. We can't wait to get started. Spread the word!
