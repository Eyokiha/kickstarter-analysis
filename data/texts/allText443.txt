The Jack Douglass Saloon is Closing--On December 28th, the Jack Douglass Saloon will be closing down. I began working at the Jack in April of 2014 and fell in love with the Saloon, the town of Columbia and the people. I have the opportunity to apply for the Concession contract, but I can't do it with out the financial backing to prove that I can pay for the various licenses, insurance and other costs of reopening the Jack. Plans for events and community involvement I plan on continuing the Saturday night music, and add an open mic night on Fridays. I'm a firm believer in community and making the Jack Douglass Saloon a gathering place and an involved part of the many events of Columbia.I Need Your Help!- This is where you come in, I need YOUR help! Together as a community, we can put the money together and reopen the Saloon as quickly as possible. The Jack Douglass has been a gathering place for the community, and a destination for visitors and needs to remain so! To cover purchasing the contract, licenses, equipment repairs, various insurances. In addition, I will also need to purchase period appropriate costumes for employees as there are none correct for the period right now. So please contribute today and lets make this happen! Risks and challenges State Approval: Once I raise the funds for the opening costs, I then have to go to the State Parks and request that I take over the contract. I am then subject to the review process. I am confident that I will be approved, but in the event I am not, all monies will be refunded to donors. The other challenge I face is getting through the rest of the winter before the busy tourist season begins again. I will address this by keeping staff to a minimum until the season.
