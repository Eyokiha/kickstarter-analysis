We all do it. We all go to the bathroom. When you live in a large city there are unique challenges that one is faced with. None greater than finding a clean and comfortable bathroom that is open to the public. Let me do the hard work for you. I'll find the cleanest, the most comfortable, the most relaxing public restrooms in Los Angeles so you won't have to. That is my gift to you. Risks and challenges There are a lot of bathrooms in Los Angeles. There are some hidden gems across this great city and I plan on investigating them. However there are a lot of bathrooms that have what I call limited access. Meaning you can't use those unless you're a customer at the establishment. Some may require a door code or a token to use. These live in a societal grey area and a snap judgement on whether they are truly public restrooms will be made at my discretion. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
