I am a disabled naval veteran who in February 2014, following a third heart attack in 15 months, the surgeon who performed the bypass stated that he doubted I would be alive in ten years. After consulting with select friends and family members, I have decided that I would try to photograph as many nature and historical sites that remain on my photographic bucket list. I purchased an old 1973 camp trailer and rehabilitated it as my photography base along the journey. I cannot say for sure, but I estimate the total journey will take between 1 and 2 years to complete. I am seeking to rise funding mainly because I live off a limited fixed monthly Veteranâ€™s Disability income.A complete list of the sites I plan to photograph is listed on my photography fan page on Facebook "Nearsighted Photographer" and if you like my fan page you will be able to follow along on this wonderful Epic Journey.Hugs to all and thank you for considering my project.Guy and the Chihuahua's Risks and challenges The main challenge to completing this project is my health and a vehicle breakdown along the way.
