This project came to life when talking with my sons doctor about his condition and him saying he was frustrated with all the applications people get advice from yet it's wrong. I am also friends with him so me being in the Internet Technology field he said someone should start a site to review medical apps that are on phones and tablets. I have a degree in web design along with Internet Technology so after much deliberation I decided if I could get some funding to pay for the site I would put my time into making it. The funds you are providing will be used to help collect information on medical apps(some apps cost money) and check how accurate the information is then review them to let people know that the app has bad information. The funds will also cover the cost of the website for a year. We went through just 3 apps in his office and found multiple errors. One app to help nurses even had the wrong dosage of insulin listed to give a patient. There is nobody that monitors Medical Apps that are all over the app store and the FDA has no plans on monitoring them right now. This website which we will add reviews all the time will help give consumers advice on which apps to trust. Risks and challenges The main setbacks will be the amount of time it takes to get reviews done. We do not want to rush to judgement on apps and want to be sure that our reviews are accurate. This will be done by getting the support of medical personal to help in review of applications. When the design of the site is done we will add the reviews we have at that time and continue to add more as fast as we can get an accurate review of the information. Any backers that are in the medical field that could contribute to medical reviews would be great-fully appreciated. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
