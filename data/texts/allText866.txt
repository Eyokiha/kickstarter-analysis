BedJet v2 obsoletes your noisy alarm clock by hacking into your body's natural biorhythm wake triggers, to wake you up gently and incredibly refreshed. All easily available through our iPhone and Android applications. BedJet air based cooling is no more stuffy summer nights waking up too hot in bed. The powerful cooling is awesome therapeutic relief for hot sleepers, night sweats and hot flashes. BedJet cooling helps you cuddle longer and never get out of bed to change the house thermostat. BedJet air based warming is not your grandmother's electric mattress pad - it's a personal toasty warm sauna right in your own bed, on-demand in just 180 seconds. The instant and powerful warming forever ends cold feet, cold legs and bundling up with layers of pajamas to get into chilly winter beds. All this while saving you money on your utility bills! Why heat or cool the whole house at night when all that matters is the temperature between the sheets? In the six months since we've shipped BedJet v1 to our original Kickstarter backers, we have rocketed to become: The No. 1 customer ranked product of any kind for staying cool in bed on all of Amazon The No. 1 customer ranked product for powered cooling and heating of a bed on all of Amazon The No. 1 ranked product of any kind in the entire mattress topper category of Amazon! Take a minute and read some of the phenomenal life changing customer reviews here. Now BedJet is returning home to where it all began, armed with some incredible sleep science and sleep temperature research, to bring you the BedJet v2, upgraded to become so much more. With BedJet v2, your smartphone or tablet becomes more than just a remote control for your bed, but one for your body as well. Sleep Better. Live Better. Sleep. It's just as important to our health and well being as exercise and nutrition. We spend 30% of our lives in bed and failure to get regular uninterrupted sleep has been medically linked to heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, loss of libido, depression and impaired cognitive function. Taking over the world, or just walking around with a smile on your face, forget about all of it if your body isn't properly recharged. BedJet v2 takes a technological leap past sleep sensors that simply monitor and educate on your prior night's sleep. BedJet v2 uses muscular bed climate control to hack into your body's own natural pre-programmed circadian biorhythm's to fundamentally alter what your body THINKS it should be doing while you are in bed. These sleep science biohacks are the result of ground breaking sleep temperature research sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the Dutch Institute for Neuroscience. The key is that your body's core temperature changes over the night: These medical studies have unlocked the incredible relationship between body core temperature, extremity skin warming and your body's natural propensity to enter and exit the various stages of sleep. Simply put, it's all about being the right temperature AND at the right time. Remember waking up in the middle night to kick the covers off because you were too hot, falling back asleep and then waking up later too cold? That's interrupted sleep and a reset to your deep sleep REM clock. It's also your body not being allowed to achieve the right body core temperature for deep sleep and your brain making a manual adjustment. We've had a multi-year collaboration with sleep doctors to translate these medical studies into a new more powerful microprocessor brain for BedJet v2. Taking into account your sex, age and body type, BedJet v2 will create a custom sleep temperature profile tailored just for you. Hour by hour, the BedJet v2 will make continuous climate control adjustments in your bed designed to help you get to sleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up feeling more refreshed. Every person is different and because of this the BedJet v2 will also learn from you. Night after night, it will incorporate adjustments to your sleep temperature profile to create over time, the perfect profile tailored just to you. Sensors will take into account any unusual changes in ambient bedroom temperature over the night and make adjustments accordingly. You will also be able to create manual temperature profiles, to activate different warming or cooling settings over your own customized time scale and recall them with simple 1-touch memory settings. End the Daily Alarm Clock Tragedy An alarm clock wakes you up by annoying you. BedJet v2 allows you to program a natural bio-hack wake up time. The wake up feature subtly alters your body's core temperature in the morning at the time of your choosing. Just like bright sunlight filling a bedroom, this will activate a pre-programmed circadian reaction in your brain resetting your internal clock to know it's time to start the day. Remember that feeling you had as a kid when you just opened your eyes in the morning full of energy, refreshed and ready to leap out of bed? Yeah, it's like that. BedJet v2 is no more noisy alarm clocks, no more hitting the snooze button four times or dragging yourself out of bed wishing you had just one more hour to linger. Climate Control TechnologyBedJet invented the entire product category of ultra-fast on-demand air based bed climate control. BedJet v2 works on any size bed and any type mattress. It's a giant remote control for your bed, to make you feel how you want, when you want and nearly instantly. The BedJet lives under your bed or at the foot of your bed: Once activated, the patent pending and precisely tuned blower, ducting system and outlet nozzle operate at a very specific air pressure to create a scientifically magical event in your bedding. The BedJet quietly generates a small cushion of turbulent air between the upper and lower bedsheets that lifts the top bedding off the bed by a small amount. This tenting effect on the bedding combined with the turbulent air flow enables the air to permeate throughout the entire sleeping area and provide even heating or cooling. Wonder how good that really feels? Check out the awesome customer reviews of BedJet v1 here. Your own bedding is used to capture and circulate the air Wireless remote control? Yeah, we got one. But the real awesomeness starts with your tablet or smart device: Installation of the BedJet v2 onto your bed is incredibly simple and done in minutes with no tools: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Cooling & Heating for BedsBedJet is the most muscular climate control product ever created for a bed. It is the first and only product that can both cool you off within 10 seconds and heat the bedding of a king size bed to feel like the sheets just came out of dryer in only 180 seconds. How's the air based cooling and heating work? Getting too hot in bed never feels good. Body heat and moisture get trapped by your mattress and bedding like an oven. Typical air temperatures surrounding your body under the bedding reach over 90 degrees. Over the course of the night we have measured up to a 20% increase in humidity in the bed from natural perspiration. BedJet Cooling mode power ventilates your bed by circulating fresh ambient temperature air into your bed to quickly wick out this trapped body heat and body moisture. You select variable amounts of air flow from the BedJet to get different levels of cooling. Wonder how good it really feels? Check out the reviews on how well the cooling works from BedJet v1 owners here. Please Note: BedJet is NOT a substitute for zero air conditioning in extreme ambient heat (80 degrees+) bedrooms. BedJet is not a portable air conditioner. Room temp needs to be below 79 degrees for best cooling. The heating mode lets you choose variable output temperature and variable air flow to help customize what feels just right for you. Turbo-Heat mode gives you a 5-minute burst of extra powerful warming (1500 watts!) to get a cold chilly bed nice and toasty in just minutes. BedJet can raise the temperature of your bedding 30 degrees in 180 seconds! There's no electric blanket and no heated mattress pad in the world that can do that -- they take up to 40 minutes to warm your bed just 20 degrees plus don't provide even heating. BedJet warming is safer, because it keeps electricity out of the bed where it belongs. Take a look below at the infra-red image of an electric blanket in actual operation in a bed. Apart from uneven heating, those electric wires are laying right up against your body! Electric blankets on infra-red, they don't heat evenly. Just say NO to electric wires in your bed! Got heavy night sweats that soak the sheets? BedJet v2 has a special temperature neutral sweat drying mode which ventilates the bed, pulling all the moisture off your body but without freezing you or overheating you. We created this unique feature for one our customers who suffered from a medical condition. But wait.... there's more!!! Dual Zone? BedJet is ending the night time battle over the thermostat between you and your partner. You want it cool and they want it warm? No problem! Using two BedJets and our patent pending AirComforter, you now have totally independent climate control systems, one for each partner. Our AirComforter accessory shown below contains two hollow cavities that distribute the air from each BedJet to each half of the bed. It is the worlds first cooling and warming blanket! It replaces your top sheet and is pure and soft 100% cotton. Want to watch it all in action? Check out this infra-red FLIR camera video that shows just how quickly the BedJet climate control works: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 AirComforter InfoThe patent pending BedJet AirComforter is a specially designed luxuriously soft 100% cotton temperature layer with two separate hollow cavities in which BedJet Air Nozzles plug in, gently distributing the warming or cooling air to a specific half of the bed. See the two sides below? AirComforter fully inflated, you will lay your normal bedding on top of it (quilts, blankets, comforters, etc) With a BedJet powered on, the AirComforter looks wonderfully puffy, soft and down filled. But it’s actually only filled with the conditioned air from the BedJet, making it one of the softest, lightest and coziest comforters ever made! BedJet air nozzle plugs right into the AirComforter! One port on each side of the bed at the bottom of the bed The AirComforter replaces your normal bedding top sheet and works underneath blankets, quilts, or regular comforters. Unlike electric blankets, the AirComforter is just pure, soft cotton and like any top sheet, can be washed over and over again. It is the worlds first warming AND cooling blanket. Use the AirComforter with just one BedJet to focus a single BedJet's warming and cooling power to one side of the bed. The side without the BedJet installed will remain un-puffed and look just like a normal top sheet! The AirComforter improves the distribution and flow of the air and also improves the performance of the BedJet in cooling modes. Use the AirComforter with two BedJet machines on a single bed, providing independent dual zone temperature control to each side of the bed with individual remote controls. This is our Dual Zone setup, which is a bundle of 2 BedJets plus the Aircomforter. Our Journey Technical Stuff On the Inside BedJet V2: Acoustic damping technology in the base unit makes BedJet incredibly quiet. Also has a computation fluid dynamic optimized exit air nozzle for laminar flow (engineering lingo for the exhaust nozzle is a muffler). BedJet sound is only 39dB measured at the bed pillow while in medium settings cool/heat mode typical of all night operation. This makes it quieter than any window fan or air conditioner. Its a wonderful background white noise whoosh that will help put you to sleep! 20,000 hour wide range DC motor to make BedJet likely to outlast your mattress Lifetime washable air filter for no dust bunnies in your bed Uniquely designed low temperature barium titanate ceramic stone heating element - operates below the temperature flash point of dust to avoid that "electric heater" smell Super Safe Electric Appliance - BedJet is certified to the same Underwriters Laboratories standards as electrified hospital beds Entire case is certified Underwriters Laboratories flameproof plastic Base unit dimensions: 16.5" long x 12" wide x 6.75" inches tall, fits under most beds Bluetooth low energy 4.0 supported Power consumption Turbo-Heat: 1500 watts max Power consumption Regular Heat: 200 to 1100 watts Power consumption Cooling: 10 to 40 watts max Project & Timeline The engineering scope of the BedJet v2 project is upgrading the BedJet v1 microprocessor brains and electronics to support the biorhythm sleep temperature capability.

About Us We are a true American start-up company based in Newport, Rhode Island, full of bright eyed inventors, engineers and gadget nerds who are part of the community of Makers. We simply love creating and sharing awesome new technology and our company was born on Kickstarter. We come from diverse technical backgrounds in the Aerospace, Medical Device, Automotive and Defense industries. Our goal is cross-pollination of technologies out of these technologically sophisticated industries into the Bedroom and the creation of devices which are delightful, therapeutic and luxurious. Special thanks to Shaun at cadmodels.com, our outside team member who helped out with some awesome industrial design. PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR FACEBOOK PAGE FOR OUR SLIGHTLY R-RATED BUT HILARIOUS BEDJET VIDEO THAT WE COULDN'T PUT ON KICKSTARTER! PS. turn the volume down a bit if you are in the office! Why We Are On KickstarterThis is where it all started. One and a half years ago you supported our vision to make the world’s first ultra-rapid climate control system for a bed. The Kickstarter community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and your feedback has shaped what BedJet is today. We are still a tiny start-up company and we are back on Kickstarter to give you - the community who cares the most - an opportunity to support our vision for applying technology to improve the bedroom experience. Because at the end of each day, success in your next one is all about getting great sleep and waking up feeling good with a smile on your face.

Like nearly all first time Kickstarter hardware creators, as newbies we underestimated the time and money required to take a prototype into full production and get it certified. In order to deliver on those campaign promises, our founder wound up mortgaging his home, emptied 100% of his life savings and mortgaged another home owned by his family. That's how committed we were. Thankfully we were able to over deliver on our product promises to our backers, the BedJet v1 is now in full production and our company is now a healthy Kickstarter alumni. BedJet v2 has far less risk to it because we are only upgrading the microprocessor, firmware and Bluetooth apps of the BedJet rather than re-engineering an entirely new platform. While is is still a major engineering project, now that we've been at this for two years we've got our arms around the engineering, schedule, cost and manufacturing risks involved with the upgrade. Our BedJet v2 delivery schedule lands during the holiday gift giving month of December. We understand how annoying it can be to miss a date like that and so we are committing this publicly to you, our backers. If we can't lock down a ship date of BedJet v2 before December 24th, then we will refund your pledge on your request anytime after December 15th. This is our promise and commitment to drive hard towards our promised schedule. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
