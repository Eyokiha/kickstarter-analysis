Traveling is great, but discovering new places when traveling is even better.There are a lot of special places that guidebooks barely mention and that even frequent travelers may not have heard of. Where is the world's deepest canyon (hint: it ain't "Grand") and did you ever heard of a hidden Greek village that dates back to the 14th century?Some examples of places everybody should visit at least once in their lifetime.Colca Canyon, Peru: Though it's overshadowed by the more famous Machu Picchu, Colca Canyon is worth seeing on any trip to Peru. Located about 100 miles outside of Arequipa, it's more than twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Keep an eye out for the Andean condor, a native bird that makes its home in and around the canyon.Margaret River, Australia: While most first-time travelers to Australia stick to the eastern coast (where you'll find Sydney, Melbourne and the Great Barrier Reef), the Margaret River region offers a compelling reason to venture over to the western side of the country. A popular wine region, Margaret River also boasts opportunities for surfing, caving, hiking and art gallery-hopping.Banaue, Philippines: This region of the Philippines is where you can see the country's spectacular 2,000-year-old rice terraces, which are believed to have been made largely by hand. They are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.We would like to create an app which allows everybody around the world to share their experience and show us some of the greatest places on earth.
