Orchestra of Our Time is bringing new works by emerging composers into the world through Call for Scores Project. Call for Scores invites composers to submit their work for performance by our ensemble. It is our goal to attract the greatest diversity of composers ranging from classical to jazz to hiphop to electronic. We will select 10 works which represent innovation, imagination, and originality for our performance on our series Music Here Now and Beyond in 2011. Our goal is $10,000 We need to raise $10,000 by December 29 to make this project a reality. Funds will be used to pay musicians, recording engineers, performance space and marketing. We believe donations from individuals is our strongest option, and Kickstarter will be the key to our success. We are offering limited edition gifts for contributors. Orchestra of Our Time is a 501 (c)(3), tax-exempt organization. All donations are tax deductible as allowed. All contributors will be listed in the Call for Scores Program and will receive one pair of tickets for the performance in May 2011 !
