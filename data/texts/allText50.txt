The Â£350 target will allow me to fulfil rewards and purchase a (railcard discounted) 7-day All Line Rover for use on all Train Companies in Great Britain. Using this, I will travel across the whole country, prioritising the coasts, stopping off and taking photos the whole time. After the trip has been completed, I will develop and compile all photos into a physical collage to display at either an art gallery, a library or school/university.Target locations include Thurso, Penzance, Newcastle, Hull, West Kirby and Swansea.Each backer will receive a link to a digital version of the photography.I aim to finish with at least 300+ photos taken. Risks and challenges There is always a chance of bad weather but this will not hinder the project! It is also possible that uploading each photo to an online storage system or data sharing website may take a while but it shall be done! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
