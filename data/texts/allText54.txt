My planned journey to New Zealand is all about experiencing a new place in the world and to meet exciting new people. However, as a photographer working primarily in travel and documentary photography, a really important aspect of my travels are to capture it through the lens of all my cameras. my trip to NZ will essentially be a photography related journey and project, and I intend to produce a massive amount of high quality, unique and engaging images from the number of locations I will be visiting. Locations include: Christchurch, Dunedin, Queenstown, Franz Josef, Nelson, Wellington, Taupo, Tauranga and Auckland. Risks and challenges A major risk involved with visiting New Zealand in the winter is the weather. It is freezing, however refreshing and still quite often sunny. However I project some unpredictable weather conditions due to the different places I will be going to. Some conditions include snow, rain and strong winds (hence the name for NZ's capital, 'Windy Wellington'). Despite this challenge, I think various weather conditions may contribute positively to my images and allow for a range of different visuals throughout my project.
