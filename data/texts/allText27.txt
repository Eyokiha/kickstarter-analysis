Through the Lens has scheduled a photo shoot at Nationals Park this season on April 10th while the Nationals are taking on the Marlins! Our ultimate goal is to capture every MLB Stadium's uniqueness one stadium at a time and share it with you through a beautiful coffee table book and interactive website. Please help us fund the Nationals Park tour so we can share our professional images with you. During the tour we will be Tweeting, sending updates to our fans and supporters, answering questions, and more! We hope that you have fun keeping up with where we are and what we are doing! Risks and challenges We have done everything possible to minimize every risk we can. Now is the time to move forward and make the project come to life! If we do end up with more funds than required, we will use it towards the west coast trips that cost a little more for us! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
