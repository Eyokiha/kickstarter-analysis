I live a dual life, as most independent artists do. Time restraints are always an issue because of this. I really can only manage or create music at night. I have been doing alright in this, for a while now, but it's time to go to the next level. There shouldn't any hold backs in the production of the album. It's just making sure that everyone is getting the best I can give them. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
