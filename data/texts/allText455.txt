I am a disabled Veteran trying to get back on my feet and fulfill my dreams at the same time. My dream is to open a restaurant here, in Orlando, which is completely run by Veterans. I am tired of hearing about Veterans, such as myself, struggling so hard to find jobs. Not only am I looking for funding, but I’m also looking for the Wounded Warriors and Veterans that are tired of facing the same obstacles and hardships that I have found in becoming a Veteran, who want to create amazing food. Together, we can provide the security those Veterans need in helping them get back on their feet. Risks and challenges Finding a good location where a new restaurant can thrive here in the ever growing city of Orlando could be a challenge. Being able to find Veterans and Wounded Warriors who not only want to help get a restaurant up and running, but want to stay and watch this restaurant become something amazing could be another challenge. Having the right marketing and advertising is another challenge. Being able to get into contact with a high profile chef who would be willing to help get Veteran Grub’s name in the right circles and help get our name out there is a risk, but one I think is more than worth it when it comes to this project.
