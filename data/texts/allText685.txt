G-PACK IS REBOOTING! Head over to our website now to follow and participate in the improvements we are bringing to G-Pack. This project is being rebooted! Over the next few weeks we'll be running through design improvements, configurations tweaking and big cost-optimizations too. In order for this exercise to be a success, we need your help, feedback and input to refine what will be your perfect G-Pack.This was our very first Kickstarter campaign and we're just better at building gaming machines than crowdfunding ... for the time being. It's been a hell of an experience and we think we have it better figured now, so bear with us, G-Pack is about to launch again!The good news is that while this first funding was unsuccessful, we've received a huge endorsement from many, many people and are more determined than ever to bring you the best gaming machine to ever enter the living-room!If you made a pledge, we are thanking you from the bottom of our heart, you have convinced us that this product deserves to be brought to market! If you wish the machine was slightly different, cheaper, faster, bigger, please go to piixl.com where we are gathering as much feedback as possible.The PiixL team Risks and challenges G-Pack is an extremely mature Kickstarter project, we've passed all pre-certification testing, our manufacturing and supply chain are already in place, so we'll be right back!
