In December of 2015 my fellow actor/writer Christine was working on a fundraising project for our home away from home, The Ruskin Group Theatre. When Christine mentioned she was looking for actors and writers to create new Christmas based short plays, I signed up as an actor right away. But this little idea kept begging my attention and I had to write it. And so Mama's Eggnog was born. In January of 2016, upon a friend's urging I sent the play off to the Samuel French OOBroadway Short Play Festival. Fast forward to May of 2016 when over my morning coffee I was checking my email only to find out that my play had made the top 30 in the festival. I was so surprised, elated and grateful and I have been on a cloud ever since. Being a finalist awards me with the incredible opportunity to bring my play to the prestigious Classic Stage Company's Theater located on East 13 street in Manhattan to compete in the festival. The top 6 plays from the festival will be published and many doors can be opened for writers through this experience. It is truly a dream come true for me. Risks and challenges Being a single mom, working two jobs and living in LA, presents me with the challenges of self producing a play that will be performed 3000 miles away from home. The opportunity is there for me to take, to advance my career and to hopefully inspire my kids in doing so. The risks are really minimal. The challenges are merely the financial ones. Producing a play, even a short one and traveling 3000 miles to stage it is an expensive endeavor. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
