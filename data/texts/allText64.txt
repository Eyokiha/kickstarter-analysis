The project that I am trying to raise money for is : Discover AmericaI have been here for 7 years and have hardly seen a few states. My goal is to really explore America through a 50 day road trip by seeing all the beautiful places in this wonderful country. I recently graduated with a degree in International hospitality management and this experience not only would allow me to truly better understand how hospitality varies from state to state but also capture all the great memories that come along with it. At the end of the trip I plan to write about my experience and share the thoughts with the rest of the world by showcasing pictures and videos I make along the way. I am really looking forward to this experience, specially driving down the historic route 66. Risks and challenges I enjoy long drives so I am not at all concerned from that point of view. The few things that I was concerned about were regarding the best way to pack-up for such a trip and finding decent places for rest. I have been doing quite a lot of research lately and I have come across some brilliantly written articles and some other websites that actually provide guidance regarding such trips.
