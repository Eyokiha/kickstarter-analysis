Simple and elegant WHERE WILL THE FUNDING GO?We're seeking funding to help with the production tooling and process. Once that is established, funds will be used to build and deliver the product. PRISMO project Risks and challenges For the PRISMO campaign, the biggest risk lies in developing the production tooling and process, scaling the product to large volumes. Prototypes were iterated upon, towards the goal of high rate production. Identifying the optimal assembly equipment and partners remains the biggest challenge. We believe there is sufficient funding for achieving this task, resulting in a low risk category. Supply chain has been established for the component parts, validating the units meet high quality and yield. Particular attention was paid to sourcing the optics, as we believe that image quality is paramount to the PRISMO experience. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
