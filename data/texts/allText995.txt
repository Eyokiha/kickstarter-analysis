Kieran Ahern and Tom Dowling are Good Kids. We've known each other for our whole lives. We've been doing theatre and comedy and that for a large proportion of it but we've clearly been unable to make the millions from it that we, "so clearly deserve." * That's where you can help us. We're looking to cover some of the cost of taking our comedy hour up to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The Fringe is incredibly exciting (especially in this post-EU, limited Arts funding world) and wonderfully diverse. It is, however, really expensive to bring a show up. All of the funds raised through this Kickstarter will go towards making the show bigger, better and more engaging for the audience - which is you, ya numpties. If you could spare anything then we would be eternally grateful and to show this we're offering a range of fun and involving Rewards.All money raised will go towards the considerable venue hire costs. :)The show we're taking up is all written, all lines have been learned and verified and preview shows have been booked. In Edinburgh we'll be performing at one of the 'Big Four' venues - the Underbelly. The theatre is Clover at Med Quad; a 60 seater room located perfectly next to George Square and lots of the University buildings. In short, we couldn't be happier and prouder with our space and with the show we've got to fill it with._________________________________________________________"Good Kids are back, and this time they've had a few. Join the fresh-faced Brummie boys for an hour down the local and a barrel full of laughs. If you've ever made a friend in the pub, then this is the show for you. Characters, songs and sketches like mom used to make. Formerly of the Oxford Revue. 'Good Kids is a total blast' **** (FringeGuru.com). 'Cleverly scripted and often witty' (ThreeWeeks). 'It's clear the duo have an easy chemistry' (List)."^^^^^^^^That's what you'll see if you go to our page on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe ticket website (https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/good-kids-on-tap). That's to show that we're reet proper like. And we're gannin to make a top show.This is the second show that we're taking up to the Fringe after last year's "smash hit" **, 'Good Kids'. This one's set in a pub. We'd like to have the ability to go to the pub to do research. And congratulate ourselves on 26 nights of laughs and love. Thanks for reading this far. If you like what you've seen and heard then feel free to pour out the contents of your virtual wallet.* - Kieran Ahern, 21 years old, Birmingham, UK** - Kieran's mom. Risks and challenges None. No, really. It's gonna happen. The room's booked. The reviewers have sharpened their fountain pens. Kieran's even booked in for a haircut. Your help just makes the whole thing go ahead without too much potential for an epic, GoodKids-style nervous breakdown. And who doesn't want to help with that? You godawful %$Â£*&$*%. Thanks.
