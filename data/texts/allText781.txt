iOS App Designs Completed Why We Exist! The User Experience Risks and challenges Working in the tech/software industry I appreciate the complexity and challenges that iOS and software development can have. Learning from past projects I have learned best practices and thinking of cost effective ways to ensure the app will be complete, perform well, and have a great user experience. We have professionally designed the app by running challenges on TopCoder to harness the power of crowd sourcing. With the clear direction we aim to host the app on AWS (Amazon Web Services) so the expense and challenges of buying and maintaining servers will be eliminated and have a subscription rate to ensure the ability to scale when needed. The app store has rigorous standards, but fortunately this isn't our first time around. We will hire industry experts to code the app, and utilize existing templates of code to help save time and limit the customization aspects. The biggest challenge will be adoption and adapting to demands for new functionality. Like an app we will do our best to be agile, and the best way to make adoption happen is the prework of the user stories and flow of of the app overall. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
