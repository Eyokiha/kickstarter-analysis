Have you ever been to a venue to see a concert or other event and felt totally lost or worried about being in an unfamiliar place? 32 million people in the U.S. alone attend music festivals a year. When you add in other events that happen all over the world each day you get a staggering amount of new locations, that often times people are making their first visit to. I am envisioning a wonderfully designed, easily accessible website-app for users to share anything and everything about the venues they visit. Let's face it, we all like to know what we are getting into. Restroom location? Bad experience with staff? Reviews down to the location of the nearest emergency exit. Photos of concessions, the possibilities are endless. This also gives the venue the opportunity to impress and be held accountable. A win win for everyone involved and a great way for us to connect with the places before we visit to enjoy a great event, even if just for a few hours. Let's help eachother feel at home with VenuePal. Risks and challenges I believe any risks can be overcome because this idea is a very particular idea that I already own the domain rights too. I require the right investors and programmer/s. I am that confident in the idea and can see everyone having this app on their mobile phones, being enthused to do something to feel more connected and helpful to others, all while being more social!
