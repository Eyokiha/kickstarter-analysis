The purpose of this Kickstarter is to bring Input & Broken's vision for "Left For Dead" to life. With the basic tools we have, we are seeking that next step to compose this record as only we can see it. We are taking this album to Colorado Sound to record, engineer and master the record; which is something we have never done. WIth the accompanying art to properly suit the record itself, we have brought in professional film makers, photographers and producers to join our team in the making of "Left For Dead" The contributions and donations that are made will allow us to create the best possible product for your enjoyment. We simply ask for your support and thank you for taking time out of your lives to listen to our music.
