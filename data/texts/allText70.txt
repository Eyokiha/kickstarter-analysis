I love all thing Vintage and as I get older it sure seems to me, that the "vintage look" sure does remind me a lot more of my childhood rather than my parents childhood.There are a few thing that I have held onto that can take me back to my youth and one of them happens to be my first car. I've been a terrible owner in leaving her parked outside for so long neglected and weathered.I want to fully restore Lola my 1970 VW Beetle to not only be safe and reliable but also make her beautiful again. In the United States there are so many rustic Americana sites that need to be photographed with Lola.This fund is to help fully restore her to modern day safety levels. Then over the next few years, travel and explore the United States while also photographing the adventure. All the Photos that will be created will fund all my travel expenses. Risks and challenges I will be doing the work myself so it will take a while to completely finish the restoration but The VW will be fully functioning in just a few weeks after the parts are ordered. 100% restored will take about 9 months.
