This social network will be designed by players for players to create the largest gaming community that might exist. From the most casual to the most professional and experienced. Anyone with the slightest contact with the world of video games can be a member of this great community. You can share photos and videos edited directly on the site using the edit mode and show your anecdotes, funny or epic moments and spectacular plays of your favorite games to all your friends and followers. You will have a quick access button to record the time you want of your game and instantly have registered on your account and then edit and publish it. You can save favorites and comment in publication that you like and get rewarded for it. You will have your own profile where you will indicate your achievements, processes and ranks that you have achieved in your favorite games to show the rest what you have been able to get. In addition this you'll also have access to a multitude of guides of any game in which you need help and you can also help other people who have problems too. In this way we will create the great community we all crave and in which everyone will meet no matter where you may be. Risks and challenges We hope it will not happen any mishap that delayed the project and we will try to move as fast as possible. It will not be easy to complete all the things we discussed but we will try with all our might if we get the necessary help. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
