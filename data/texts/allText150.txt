The release of enTraance’s debut album, ‘Nebraska’ We’re raising funds to master and release ‘Nebraska’, the debut album of Minnesota-based band enTraance.enTraance plays a new style of music loosely titled ‘Baroque Breakbeat’ that combines strings in the Baroque style, propulsive 21st Century drumming, and synthesizers.The goal of enTraanceI plan for enTraance to become an international group that tours the world, playing beautiful, haunting, hard-hitting instrumental music.The music marries propulsive, intricate rhythms; edgy and aggressive synthesizers; with sweeping, majestic strings. I will play drums and percussion and will be joined by a string quartet, keyboardist, bassist and guitarist. A dancer will also join the group and be featured on many of our songs; her choreography will reflect the epic, percussive music.The experience of seeing enTraance will be an immersive one. I hope for this group to continue in the tradition of Pink Floyd, The Cure, Sade, and other groups that successfully create a sonic and visual world that audiences can visit and inhabit.The birth of enTraanceenTraance is a music project conceived in the spring of 2014 during a composer’s residency at the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts in Nebraska City, NE. During the 6-week residency, I wrote music incorporating strings, advanced drumming influenced by my studies of Cuban and Brazilian percussion, and synthesizers.I spent much of my free time during the residency driving around scenic rural Nebraska and taking pictures of its scenic landscapes and stunning nature. This album is a love letter to Nebraska: the cover art is comprised of my favorite photos from my time in the state; the songs were all composed during the residency; and the album even begins and ends with the sounds of the world famous Sandhill cranes of central Nebraska.The debut performance of enTraanceTo date, enTraance has only performed once—at The Underground, a venue located underneath Duluth, Minnesota’s historic Depot, on June 7th, 2014. I played drums and percussion and was joined by two excellent Duluth-based artists: a violinist and a dancer.Creating and producing ‘Nebraska’Almost immediately following the debut performance, I was awarded an ‘Artist Fellowship’ from the Arrowhead Regional Arts Council of NE Minnesota (with support from the Arts and Cultural Heritage Funds from the State of Minnesota) and worked on the production of ‘Nebraska’ until the spring of 2015.The release of ‘Nebraska’ was delayed one year because of a move from Duluth to the Twin Cities in March 2015 and the resulting complications of starting new jobs, moving, and resettling.Future plansThis year, I plan to release ‘Nebraska’ and hold several CD release parties, compose new music, form the band with all members, and begin rehearsing for live shows in the fall.BudgetThe following is a budget for the project:1. Photos $2002. Graphic art $1103. CopyCats - reproduction $11904. CopyCats – 1100 download cards $3085. Mastering $5506. Postage $100 7.Kickstarter fee and credit card processing fees (about 5% each) $242Total $2700Stretch goalsAny additional funds raised through this Kickstarter campaign will be used to create a music video and/or the next enTraance album.The song ‘Soundtrack to Life’ (this song is the main song that plays during the Kickstarter video shown above) would lend itself very well to a video treatment. I have contacted a Miami-based video producer and we have discussed my ideas for a video for this song. I estimate that this video would cost between $3,000 and $10,000.I may spend extra funds on the production of the next enTraance album, which I intend to be a live album released on vinyl. I estimate that the production of this album would cost $5000. Risks and challenges I honestly don’t see many risks or challenges to this project. The music is fully mixed and complete, the photos have been selected; I have requested exact costs for duplication and mastering; Copy Cats, the replication studio, is ready to copy; studio time has been booked at Rare Form Mastering. There are always challenges to any artistic release; there might be unexpected delays in the release of this album or a technical problem that I don’t foresee. But I think these possibilities are remote. The only major risk is not being fully funded, so please contribute! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
