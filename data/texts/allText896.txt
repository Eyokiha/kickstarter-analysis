I believe that will live in a society today where technology has empowered us to become independent and self conscious. With Climate change that delay most flight and the economy pushing us to find more ways to earn money in our own way..Crazy ride is the app that allows each of us to earn a decent amount of money while travelling by road. Many of us travel either for business or leisure and most time riding alone so why not share the remaining seat in our car by offering them to riders in need for an affordable fee.It saves the environment, encourage social and physical connection in a world where everything is becoming virtual, build relationship and last it allows the driver to earn money while conducting his own business.through the app a traveler will be able to set a travel plan and be connected to a driver that match the same destination, set a pick up location and travel while enjoying the country at a very affordable rate. Risks and challenges I am committed to make this app the next big thing no matter what I have to do. I invested to much of my little capital and never give up to what I believe in. the biggest challenge in my opinion will be the marketing part which required lots of capital to tackle that I will have to rely on old traditional marketing going door to door to area and niche I define suitable to enjoy the benefit of the app. Since it is a service app , legal matter can arise so I working to find a qualified team who believe in my vision and who work in the field so I can decrease these cost.
