The TWILY 7 Day Acts of Kindness Challenge has been designed for students of all school ages to greatly improve their social interactions with others, develop and improve empathy, encourage respect for others, reduce negative behaviour and bullying whilst increasing self-esteem and producing a positive atmosphere around the kids and school. By encouraging the children to participate in the 7 Day Acts of Kindness Challenge, we believe it will not only be a great source of fun and pride, but also, create a positive message. We are looking to develop an iPhone app that will incorporate an Acts of kindness component as well. This is where someone will receive an Acts of Kindness card. The idea is that the card holder does a random act of kindness for someone (friend, colleague, stranger etc) then passes on the card to that person and asks them to do the same. Hopefully, that person will follow the same steps and each card will pass from person to person with each person entering their info into the App. Then, you can track your act of kindness and where it spreads around the world on the app.We are looking for people who want to change the world. One act of kindness at a time. Risks and challenges We Come from a successful business background and are not overly tech savvy. This is an obstacle that we feel will be a challenge, however, with the right team, this roadblock is minimised. We believe that developing a great team in areas where we are limited, lowers our risk. We believe we have got the best team and this will be an extremely successful venture.
