Help the Friends of Mount Auburn Cemetery produce a CD recording celebrating Boston’s rich musical heritage through songs and piano works composed by individuals now buried at Mount Auburn. Arthur Foote monument close-up Deep in the archives of the Spaulding Library at the New England Conservatory of Music lies a vast collection of music. We found special compositions – buried in these files – that have never been recorded and are unknown to most current musicologists, musicians, and vocalists. Why is this music so important to us? It tells an important set of stories: the history of American music; the history of the New England School of American composers of the late 19th century, who are responsible for the first body of distinctly American concert music; and the stories of several talented musicians buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. We want to celebrate the creativity of our eternal residents, bringing to life the works of the following composers: George Whitefield Chadwick (1854-1931), Mabel Wheeler Daniels (1878-1971), Arthur Foote (1853-1937), Margaret Ruthven Lang (1867-1972), John Knowles Paine (1839-1906), Daniel Pinkham (1923-2006), and Randall Thompson (1899-1984). Soprano Jean Danton has spun the words of Julia Ward Howe (1819-1910), Thomas Bailey Aldrich (1836-1917), and Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) into song, trilling high above pianist Thomas Stumpf's graceful key strokes. All songs and piano works in this project will be performed by soprano Jean Danton and pianist Thomas Stumpf. Liner notes prepared by musicologist Steven Ledbetter for the CD recordings will illustrate the significance of these composers and authors and guarantee their place in American music history. If fully funded, recording for the CD will take place in the fall of 2013. The CD will be produced in time for a spring 2014 debut, with a debut concert in Story Chapel likely in June of 2014.

Risks and challenges The only foreseeable challenge we face in completing this project is timing of the production of the CD. If there is any delay in production, we will notify all project backers as soon as possible. If possible, we will send digital downloads or project peeks so that you can follow along with the progress. We will still honor all other rewards, including the private reception, and provide them as soon as we can. We will also compensate backers with some sort of experience as a thank you for your patience! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
