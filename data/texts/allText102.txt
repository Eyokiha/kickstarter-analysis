For years we have documented the roads in Arizona. We ask for your support to allow us to continue our exploration. We have been traveling greater distances which requires more funding in both rising fuel costs and equipment maintenance. Without continued documentation and education, we risk loosing the land we have come to love. Some of these trails are so remote, no one has driven on the roads since the days of covered wagons. My videos depicts some of our best explorations. We have over a hundred documented trails/trips. We have a growing membership on facebook and youtube. I have purchased hosting space and am in the process of building our website. Risks and challenges There really isnt much risk. We will push forward to complete our tasks. This is the only project i am working on. Its been a lifelong goal and nothing brings me more joy then sharing the secrets of the trails with everyone. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
