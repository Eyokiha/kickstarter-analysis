I make music. I've been doing it for 20 years now. I am also a person with mental illness and have had many hardships over the course of my life. I'm doing well these days, thanks to my family and the doctors I've seen over the years. There are others less fortunate than myself, unable to afford the care I got nor the medications needed to treat mental illness. These people suffer. One thing I've always wanted to do is produce a record that I could promote and sell and whose sales I could donate a portion to NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.All the songs to be included on the record are finished, the only thing remaining is to master and press the CD. Discmakers will press the CDs and efforts will be made to get the CD featured in Discmaker's catalog and website. Once the CD is on hand, 100 copies will be mailed to radio stations. Follow up via phone will focus on educating music programmers about the CD, the artist and the plight of the mentally ill. Programmers will be asked to feature the CD and urge listeners to purchase a CD from the website (www.esness.com). In order to maximize exposure for the CD, a PR/marketing firm will be contracted for a year to handle marketing of the CD and myself. The money I am asking for through the Kickstarter website will pay for:1. Mastering $15002. Pressing $17003. PR/Marketing $12000
