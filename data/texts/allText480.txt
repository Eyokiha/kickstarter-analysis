ACID is an independent film that examines the depth of real corruption in our federal government and the lengths to which it will go to achieve and maintain power and influence. By using real science and real events experienced by the producer, Peter Poulsen, ACID takes a look at how vulnerable the American public is to collusion and treason perpetrated by members of our own government. But to pull off this important film, we need help. We are choosing some of the best unknown talent in the country and making this a very slick but raw story that will cause the audience to take a step back and reevaluate their emotional decision-making process. We are shooting everything in Southern Oregon but we still have lodging, crew, and food expenses. So please help us do something important. THANK YOU! Risks and challenges ACID is not without its challenges. If we reach our targeted goal of 50,000.00, and are able to wrap up shooting, we then have the daunting task of marketing and distribution. We aren't going to lie. But, exposing the truth, even in a movie format can be blocked - just as in our story. There are people out there who may not want this story to see the light of day. But we hope that we are just small enough and inconsequential enough to slip through the cracks - we hope. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
