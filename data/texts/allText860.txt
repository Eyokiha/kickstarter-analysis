The CableCastThroughout the years almost all of us have faced the challenge of a ripped Lightning Connector! It's annoying, costly, and inconvenient. It's about time someone invented a better solution....Introducing the CableCast! The CableCast helps protect and prolong the life of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Lightning Cable. With a simple and elegant design, you'll be able to make use of the CableCast without compromising the function of your Lightning connector. The CableCast in all of it's glory! Now, we aren't completely clueless – Sure, there are generic cables, but did you know those are more likely to DAMAGE YOUR DEVICE, than actually Sync and Charge them? Nothing is better than the original.So protect your original Apple Lightning Cable with the CableCast before it's too late!What is the CableCast?The CableCast is an inexpensive investment into the protection of your original iPhone Cable. More traditionally speaking, It's a tiny little plastic piece that clips onto your Apple Lightning Cable, preventing it from ripping at the weak point.What Makes the CableCast Better?Sure, we've seen other lightning cable protectors, but the CableCast is the best. Why you may ask? Unlike the other Lightning Cable Protectors, the CableCast uses the Plastic tip of the Cable as a backbone or structure – completely eliminating any possible joints for rips or tears from standard use. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––*WARNING* History LessonThe Original CableCastSince December of 2014, We've been printing out versions of the CableCast back at our office. It was then that we knew our baby had been born. The Original CableCast After testing that version, we decided to take our designs to a professional, and hired our own CAD designer.
