"The Ham Country Revival" is a Bellingham country music festival that will take place in downtown Bellingham bars/music venues. Six shows over three nights at multiple venues the weekend of October 6-8. The festival will consist of six shows total; two shows each night. An early show (8-10) at a smaller venue with two bands/ musicians with a suggested donation of $3, and a late show (10-1) at a larger venue with four bands with a door cover of $5 The primary goal of “The Ham Country Revival” is to celebrate the great country music scene here in Bellingham and the Pacific Northwest. The festival is also intended to celebrate and benefit the musicians. Primarily through performance but also through encouraging attendees to purchase records, cd's, and other band merch, meanwhile simultaneously collaborating with artist and local business integral to our music scene in Bellingham. Money donated to the Kickstarter will primarily go to the traveling musicians, seven of the bands are either from Seattle (100 miles away) or have members from the Seattle area. Another portion of the donations will go toward the advertisement costs. Magazine ads, posters, and hand bills. All in all the bands, the bars/venues, and the music community in Bellingham are the reason this festival has the potential to be great!
