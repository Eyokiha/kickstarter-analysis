Risks and challenges Risks: Obtaining all the gear necessary to complete this project. :Printing all of the pictures for the rewards. The gear will be obtained with the money raised, I have no doubt in my mind that I'll be able to fulfill everything I need with your donations! As for getting the photos printed I already have a professional lab set up that can process as many orders as I throw at them. I have used them before and they are extremely exceptional especially when it comes to canvas prints. Though challenges might present themselves in my line of work we always learn to persever and overcome anything that is thrown at us! Thank you again! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
