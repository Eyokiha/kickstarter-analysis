Back to the Books is the first of many in our growing line of EDM events. Nig-Chink-Psi, a multi-racial organization, is planning to host their first event to kick off the new college semester with the city's most unique EDM concert. In order to achieve this goal we are planning to rent out a local club for the night. This event will be targeted towards the college students but anyone over eighteen is welcome. The $2000 will cover the cost of renting the venue, security, waste management, lights and sound. Risks and challenges Shipping dates of the promised items is not guaranteed to the set date. We will keep those who have sent in the funds for the event updated as to the status of their items. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
