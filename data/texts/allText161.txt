I am raising funds to buy a groovebox, midi keyboard, audio software and various necessary gear to get back into sequencing electronic tracks like the three that are up on NoiseTrade.com/lotusthief. I will, upon funding, get to work-ya totally does not feel like work-on getting the two albums out by the end of the year. Also the bonus tracks and album art will flow pretty easy too. I don't have a day job, I am on disability for PTSD mostly, so when I'm not at a doctor's office, I like to be creative to channel the panic. Creating and editing/mastering electronic music tracks at one time was my go to therapy for my panic disorder and anxiety caused by the PTSD. So with the gear I buy, in my home, in my free time, I'll be jammin... get on board! So help fill the world with more music. This video is FUN it's some original music with animation made from an mri of my spine, between back surgeries. Risks and challenges The only thing standing in my way once I am funded is me and PTSD. That's the cool thing, the nervousness and panic will be channeled into electronica and developing the album medias. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
