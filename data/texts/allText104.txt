The Maldives, a tropical paradise on Earth, yet at only just over a meter above sea level they are gradually being reclaimed by the sea.The islands are very small and remote making them the ideal holiday destination for honeymooners and celebrities getting away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.Sadly trips to the Maldives can be expensive and many people may miss out on a real slice of paradise.There are very few high quality photos and videos of the Maldives available, and certainly no Google StreetView. Thus the aim of this project is to capture some of that magic in a way which allows people to experience one of the most popular island destinations.CInsideMedia have years of experience in 360 degree panoramic photography with work featuring everything from shops and hotels to submarines and World War 2 Royal Navy Destroyers. Our work has been featured in online news editorials including Engadget, The Register, The Daily Mail Online and The Wall Street Journal so we're confident we can capture our own slice of paradise to share with the world.The sea is rich with life in the Maldives, so should our backers be kind enough to best our Goal we hope to extend our time and take a dip under the waves to take some stunning 360 stills and video in the waters surrounding the island.Thank you all for reading and in advance for your kind pledges! Risks and challenges As with any travel there is the potential for things to go wrong (bags going missing etc) However we always take spare cameras etc to minimize the risk. Weather is also a factor, but we have been assured rain doesn't normally last long and we have a two week window in which to capture the shots we need. Experience is something we have an awful lot of so we're confident we can handle pretty much anything thrown our way, though if there's a Tsunami I reserve the right to hoof it!
