This is what the page will look like once you have searched for the nearest course to you, as you can see the map view at the top and the table view down below. On the website you will also be able to search for open competitions that are happening near you, the toolbar on the side will be in the same position on every page making it easy to search again wherever you are on the website. Each individual golf course will have their own page that they can design themselves by using widgets. There is a link to these pages from the search results page shown at the top of the page. Golf courses will have to pay a fee to have their course on the website, over time their may be the possibility of a partnership with BRS golf allowing people to book tee times on the website or app so they don't have to leave the one site from searching all the way through to booking. Risks and challenges One of the challenges that may be faced is golf courses not wanting to pay at the start to have their course on this site so might be free at the start and once they see that it is successful then can charge them. Another challenge may be courses not regularly updating the status so may hire an employee who will update the status for each course. Not many people will know about this website initially so will have advertising campaigns on websites such as golf stores and in golf magazines. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
