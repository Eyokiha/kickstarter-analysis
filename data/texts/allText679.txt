Hello world. Welcome to my kickstarter project page. My name is Joseph Sambriski and I am seeking funding for "The Cell Caddy", my patent-pending product. I have tested the prototype model that you see in the pictures and video and am ready to have it manufactured.Production plan: The purpose of the funds is to have a plastic injection mould made so that The Cell Caddy can be manufactured. Currently I have a manufacturer here in New York and will use the funds to have The Cell Caddy made professionally.What is The Cell Caddy? The Cell Caddy is a convenient way to store your devices while they charge and/or when not in use. I have tried to find an inexpensive yet quality way to charge my iPhone and my iPod Touch and found that there is no product on the market made to hold more than one device.Most of the time we all leave our device on a nightstand, a table, or kitchen countertop while charging it which takes up space and has the possibility of being knocked to the floor or having something spilled on it and getting damaged. Others leave their devices on the floor near the outlet but why risk having it getting stepped on or kicked.The Cell Caddy fits 2 devices; namely the iPhone, iPad, iPad mini, iPod Touch, Nook, Kindle, Droid, Samsung & Blackberry phones, etc.How does it work? 1) The 3M Command strips provided will adhere to The Cell Caddy so just peel and adhere to the wall. There are no tools needed for this installation method and The Cell Caddy can easily be removed and hung in another location. A little about me: I am a former assistant golf teaching professional and I lost my job in 2009 due to a bad economy. I started my own company when I came up with an educational math board game called Diceathon which is selling to schools across the country and now I am focusing on this new project which I know will succeed with your help. Risks and challenges Getting the plastic injection mould fabricated is the biggest challenge the project faces right now. Once that mould is finished, units will be run off. I have fulfillment already in place. Other risks or challenges that may need to be overcome will depend on the demand. Should any other road blocks come up I will keep everyone in the loop by updating this project page. __________________________________________________________ Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
