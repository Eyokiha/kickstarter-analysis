ALL ROADS LEAD TO OCCIDENTAL is a very low-budget indie feature to be shot on the RED in September and will star William Van Noland, Yinique-Myo Flores, Chris Miller and Rhett McKinney. We had a wonderful acting and casting studio called the IT Factor Studios that helped us fill out some of the key roles on the basis of William’s involvement and the strength of the script. We are currently in the middle of production and need your help to finish the project! STORY SYNOPSIS: A tragic love story and suspense thriller that unfolds in a non-linear fashion. ALL ROADS LEAD TO OCCIDENTAL is about love and loss, triumph and heartbreak. It is an inversion of crime-love films such as Bonny and Clyde and True Romance. Rather than the lovers trying to pull off crime, they are trying to escape it. Cheryl is a tough beautiful young woman from Occidental, CA with a heart of gold. She is bright and has big dreams but she is stuck working in a convenience store in Occidental and tied down in a loveless marriage with a local cop named Nick. Danny is a bright young man and recovering nerd also from Occidental. He has broken off some of his home town roots as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. He returns home for the summer and he and Cheryl fall deeply in love. Besides their love being taboo since Cheryl is married, it is also greatly challenged. Nick and his buddies peddle illegal drugs throughout the area. He uses his buddies as his personal NSAto jealously guard Cheryl. They are also involved in the disappearance of a missing CountyDEA named McGraw. When an FBI agent that Cheryl had an affair with named Sean discovers this information, he attempts to use it to leverage Cheryl’s affection implying that she may have a degree of involvement. Passions and sparks fly: Cheryl is torn between her love for Danny and her sense of guilt and obligation towards Nick as the clock ticks closer to the time Sean will carry out his ultimatum. Danny is torn by his love for Cheryl and his fear of risk and need to do the ‘right thing’. Nick is marred by suspicion and jealousy and at the same time filled with tenderness and affection toward his new wife. The messiness of love is at odds with the fragility of the perfect crime as the movie drives to it’s inevitable bloody climax…All Roads Lead to Occidental is a heartbreaking roller-coaster tale that won’t soon be forgotten. 2011 A GRAHAM LEE FLICKhttp://arltomovie.com/ THE IMPACT: We have all dedicated months if not years of our time and invested an enormous amount of energy and hard work into bringing this vision to the big screen.
