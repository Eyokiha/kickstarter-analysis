Ks is one of the best place for photos. Everyone believes Ks is just flat farm land but there is so much more to it than that. I will portray in my photos all the beauty this land has to offer. Kansas does have some plains with one tree. No fun for hide and seek. But there is so much more. By backing this project you will be helping me make my dreams come true. And letting me help my family in the process.If you have feedback for me I would love to hear it. I am also willing to answer any questions you may have. I am going to print off 5X7 and 8X10 photos with a description of where and what they are. Some of these will be framed for sale and others will just be the prints for sale. But all will be great. Everyone join me on this wonderful journey. Risks and challenges The risk to my great project is not getting funded. I know that I have everything planned to a T. I am going to do all I can to make sure my project gets seen by many. I have pure faith that I will get funded. I have worked hard all my life taking care of otherâ€™s needs. I know now that it is my time to take care of me. The forces that be will help me on my way to greatness. Selling will be no problem. I am going to start out on eBay then move sales to my website as the year goes on and I get more photos and traffic. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
