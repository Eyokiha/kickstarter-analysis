This production is to be with almost no funding at all. With a small but extremely talented team, the only things we need the funding for are; Some cine lenses - to make the short as cinematic as possible to send to those film fests! Funding would also go to paying actors and a film location for the police interrogation room!The short is a psychological thriller about a man who seems to have a couple of strange fainting occurrences/blackouts on the saturday. To his annoyance, he is missing a date with the girl he likes by deciding to go to bed early that evening. Waking up to some loud banging and police shouting at him to open his front door, he realises it is monday morning. He has slept through the whole of sunday. The police manage to break through the door, and arrest him. Confused and panicking, next thing he knows he is in a police interrogation room with a forensic psychologist who is about to explain what is going on. Risks and challenges After funding, we will go in to production where the hard work starts. As a great team, we have all the necessary crew to make sure the production goes smoothly, but does it always. No. You never know what is round the corner, we may struggle to find an available set, and result to building up our own one, we might not get permission to shoot in places. These are struggles we may well have and will work through them. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
