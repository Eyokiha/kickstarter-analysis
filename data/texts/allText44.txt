I am a thirty something who really like playing with Lego during childhood. Now instead of building with Lego bricks, I decided to take photos of Legoman at various landmarks. HippopoThames by Florentijn Hofman, on River Thames. Taken in September 2014 Target date of delivery of the rewards will be February 2015. I will update here on Kickstarter as and when I have taken new photos. Risks and challenges A photography project isn't really high risk. I have the time, camera kit and know a few reputable printing companies. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
