The Momtasks app will be able to find where you are using GPS. It will then locate people (momtaskers) in the area who can assist you with a variety of things within a short time frame. Its perfect if you need a quick errand done. Anything from picking up something at the store, pickup dinner for you or drive someone somewhere. The two parties will meet in a location of the customers choice. The customer will be able to setup payment using a mobile device so the momtasker will never have to use any of their own money for purchases. The hope is while the mom is out doing their errands that all moms due anyway they will be able to make extra money. Risks and challenges The biggest challenge that we will have will be to find the people to do the errandS and task for our customers. We will have to explain to them that it is a business within a business. They will the ability to make extra money while doing the things they would normally be doing on a day to day basis. We have 20 years of experience in retail and sales so we will be able to explain this process thoroughly. Customers will be easy to find because we have all been at the point where we have said â€œif only I could find someone to help me with something I need to get or something I need to do. But we will have to instill trust so the awkwardness will go away from people they have never met before handling their tasks. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
