This project is the culmination of years of talking and dreaming. Graeme Campbell and Dave Gellett have played together for almost 20 years in a variety of different events and settings. Together they want to produce a worship EP that has the raw elements of country rock, blues and folk. The funds will pay for studio time, and if enough is raised for a producer too.Once the EP is record edge we're putting on a worship night and launch party, hopefully in December, we'd love it if you were part of that. Risks and challenges The songs themselves are pretty much written, but we intend to make them even better and we'll spend time honing and crafting our sound to produce the best project we can, Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
