The Collected Works of Ross Wells is a academic and historic project to publish the written scripts for the plays and screenplays that have been produced on stage and for the screen. The collection will include background histories and photographs of the productions:1. Of Strange Voices and Watermelon Men, originally conceived and written as a one-act play at Texas Tech University and staged at the University Theatre under the mentorship of Dr. Clifford Ashby; later developed as a full-length play and produced on stage by the Lockhart Community Theatre (Lockhart, Texas); then adapted as a digital video production under the title Raven's Nightmare for Austin Community Television (ACTV).2. Haunting Mary Shelley, written as a Master of Arts Thesis and produced on digital video by the Mass Communications Department at Texas Tech University, the first narrative dramatic production in their department, featuring Houston HS for the Performing Arts graduate Alice Doggett as Mary Shelley, who created Frankenstein and New York University actor/poet/historian/educator Bill Durham as rebel poet Percy Shelley.3. Dark Lady of Salem, written as a play for the stage after extensive research in Concord and Salem, Massachusetts, concerning author Nathaniel Hawthorne and his dual attraction to the devilish darkness of socialite Mary Silsbee and the wholesome lightness of reclusive muse Sophia Peabody. Risks and challenges If publication delays are encountered, the publication dates would be set back but backers would get their rewards upon completion. Digital versions of the produced projects are currently available for streaming or DVD duplication. Photographs have been taken but need to be published. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
