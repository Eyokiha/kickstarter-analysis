I want to create an educational website for kids that include activities, games, videos, facts and much much more. So I need your help to make this possible. It will be a ONE website that the kids will love and learn.With these funds, I will be able to cover the costs of building the website, hosting it, create a mobile app, maintaining it and other costs like logo, design etc.With your help, our kids will learn new things every day, can have fun and play games. Risks and challenges The main challenge is finding the right people to support the website. Once I overcome this challenge then I can take care of the rest. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
