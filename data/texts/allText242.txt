As I am heading into my Senior year of college as a music student, I have realized that I need to get some of my work recorded. By doing so I will be able to submit my work to summer programs, graduate schools, and event planners that are looking for a musician of my kind. On top of that the album will be an eclectic mix of both classical voice standards, jazz standards and a few selections from broadway. Risks and challenges There is a large overhead cost in creating an album, I have been able to raise some of the money on my own but it is time to ask help from willing investors. All of the funds will go to overhead costs, such as equipment rental, musicians fees, studio fees, and so on. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
