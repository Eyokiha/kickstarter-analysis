These cells are not flexible and not thin at all because they have to be protected by a tempered glass.The monocrystalline and polycristalline cells hate been covered with shade or dirt, the entire circuit can break down. The output power dropped by 90%.The thin-film solar panel is flexible (roll-able) and can also be folded (so that your cards are able to fit into the SUNO WALLET). You can sit on it, walk on it, jump on it, drop it from an airplane and it will still do its job (but your money and cards inside the wallet might be destroyed or lost).High temperatures and shade have few impact on thin-film solar panel performance (5% loss max). That's why the thin-film solar panel can generates electricity through a window: at home, at the office, in your car, in your RV, practically everywhere.Our thin-film solar panel is totally cadmium telluride (CdTe) free!The high-efficiency thin-film solar panel allows you to generate electricity with regular incandescent lighting: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

There are so many amazing projects out there, it is going to be hard to get the attention we need to make this wallet successful. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help us spread the word. Once the funding is in place, our challenge will be producing a very large quantity of wallets, and making sure all the partners I'm working with maintain our quality standards. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with the companies we are working with for years and establishing a solid communication base that has given us a lot of confidence in them. SHIPPING: We tend to prioritize sending the areas requiring a longer delivery time, so that all the backers can get them at a similar time. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
