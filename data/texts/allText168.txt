Introducing Chris Jay - The EPAfter working on remixes and demos for over 10 years, I'm ready to start my own production company, producing and releasing original material - pop music you can dance to (think Almighty Records, Disko Warp). In order to do this, I need to replace my broken MacBook, and buy a decent microphone.How will I do this?I have 4 amazing tracks that I have completed the instrumentals for, 2 of which already have lyrics and the other 2 are having their lyrics rewritten to avoid future publishing problems. Once I have a new MacBook and a microphone, I shall record the tracks, have them professionally mastered, and completed by around October this year.What are the songs like?The 2 tracks that are completely written are 1-4-3 and Revenge. The 2 tracks that are having the lyrics rewritten are Recipe For Disaster and Sisters Of The Brotherhood. The instrumentals have been written by myself, and the lyrics have been (and will be) written by Charlie Mason (Miley Cyrus, Ashley Tisdale, Danny Saucedo), MÃ¥ns Ek (Sarah Connor, Jeanette Biedermann, Denise Lopez), and Jonas Thander. Plans for the futureI have my sights set high, with 200+ unfinished songs, and a great circle of songwriters and producers I can collaborate with. I'd also like to be able to offer my services to up-and-coming artists in need of a producer. All releases will be professionally mastered, and released digitally, with limited edition physical copies made available for selected releases. To get an idea of the kind of music I'll be making, please check out my SoundCloud Sets :) Risks and challenges Having the songs already written, the only obstacles I potentially have are mastering delays, and publishing delays. I shall keep all of my backers up-to-date with what's happening. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
