Too many people all over the world do not know how to get help. Let's make the world a better place for you and for them. We live in a selfish world, but Socialize can change a little bit the world, and you can as well. We are going to offer to the people a web site where they can:- ask for help: you need a medical or legal advice? You can ask to the doctors or layers giving advices for free! If you need the help of a plumber/electrician, painter, or whatever you need, you can ask the help of those people signed in Socialize, and decide if pay them with money or with something in change. If they want, they could even help you for free. For them is a good action, and a very good publicity; and you get your help! - Giving advices: share your competences and experiences on the different and appropriate areas of the website! Areas: - Legal, medical, everyday life (women and men), psychology, meeting people, sport, culture, studies, animals, finding and offering job, - in your account you must specify what concrete help you might give; giving advices must be for free. But you can publicize your job and get paid for a concrete help, or asking for a job all around the world.- the most important aspect of Socialize: If you know someone (e.g. old people alone, poor, or animals without an house) you can inform the Socialize community and everbody can help as he - she can! Risks and challenges Setbacks can happen anytime and anywhere. I'm counting on a group of people (web designer, web developer...) very highly qualified, we work together since 10 ears and we can face any kind of problem might arise! Half of the money we'll get will be spend on advertisement. I'm sure it will be a success. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
