We are proud to bring you HreyesOnly.comA website dedicated to Corporate recruiters only. No more annoying third-party recruiters fighting Corporations for the best people, to turn around and charge them a fee. Corporations will save on contractors and direct hires, while the candidates gain because companies are able to offer them more money. It's pretty simple really. Now is the time to get, retain and train the next generation of leaders. The is a major talent gap upon us and companies need to find the right talent today and make sure the retirees train them before they ride off into the sunset. Together lets find tomorrows leaders. Risks and challenges I need to add more features such as online video interviews to save companies time and money, as well as the unemployed in gas, tolls, etc. I have also ran out of money to host and advertise.
