How does a being become a human being? Are the qualities we define as human superimposed on a basically animal nature? These questions will be evoked in "You are what you eat", an experimental short movie with touches of surrealism and grotesque aesthetic. The film centers around Monsieur Glouton, a man who transforms himself into a pig-like creature. This transformation will be happening in a degenerative process of eating which will be focused in detail and production design. "You are what you eat" is the project for my senior thesis in the Film/Video program at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Although the school provides the equipment such as cameras and lights, I still in need for economical support to cover production expenses like props, sets,actors and crew. I want this project to have high quality results and this can be possible with your help. Thanks for your grand support! Claudia Quigua.
