Mobile Politics is a mobile-friendly responsive website that utilizes a flat-file database to store .ical files full of local government assembly and meeting dates. Members of the service will create a profile that stipulates issues of their choice, e.g., school district meetings or historical architectural preservation committees, etc., based on their zip-code, and will receive push notifications alerting them of upcoming meetings. In addition, the website will compile stores submitted by users of local journalism from blogs, newspapers and magazines that contain prurient editorials and articles informative of the facets and perspectives on issues relevant to their respective locality. This will both elevate the tenor of political discussion for well-informed citizens, brushing aside the highly distracting and divisive red herrings that often dominate water cooler discussions and erode the civility of dinner-table decorum. Agendas will be available to members to allow for a primer for the political event, so that all in attendance will have a clue as to how to participate and when the floor will be opened for a discussion of new topics. The fears of disruptive attendees will hopefully not deter those prospective participants with genuine interest in advancing their points of view to a community of their neighbors and recognizing the customs of their locality. Risks and challenges Realistic complications include the many different file types that these calendars might be published in. Some are in .pdf format, which will require tedious file data entry. But this will hopefully change overtime as this app proliferates and users begin to input their own local political .ical data into the database, effectively restructuring the source of power in politics nationwide.
