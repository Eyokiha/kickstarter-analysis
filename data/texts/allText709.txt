We would like to use this fundraising process to setup assembly and distribution for these kits. We are looking to make kits in large quantity to keep pricing as low as possible. We need to design packaging and graphics for retail applications. We are ready to start producing these product immediately. Risks and challenges There are always risk in everything we do in life. We could get hit by a car, struck by lightning, or die in a plane crash on any given moment. I Choose to do something to help other people that don't have what we do. My expertise is LED lighting. I have worked with DC powered lighting for more than twenty years. I developed several patents utilizing LED lighting. I believe God put me here to help develop a better light source. I have started several companies and know what needs to be done to complete projects. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
