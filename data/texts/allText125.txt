We didn't hit the last goal of $2,000, so I lowered it to $700, anything will help for travel... I lowered the goal to be a little more realistic, this is drastically important to get me from point A to point B for shows... It is all about the fans and making it happen guys!!!This project is funding my tour in April, where I will be Djing in Vegas, California, New York, Washington D.C., Miami, etc.... Going to be dope!f3ttomanagement@gmail.comhttp://facebook.com/f3ttoCOSTS $$$$$$$ F3tto Merchandise = $1000 Making the F3tto merchandise alone and getting enough for shows is hard as it is. Vlad is my guy who prints all my stuff and he does a great jo, he is the man. (T-shirts, stickers, posters, flashdrives with music!) The real deal.... shop.f3tto.comPR for the Tour = $500 going to busing some great companies for this to spread public all of the shows to blogs, radio stations, venues, fans, etc... This is important otherwise no one shows up to the venues...Gas, living, and food = $1000 This will keep me alive during the tour, I will be driving along with Monstro and its going to be a wild experience I need some travel time, but gas and oil changes add up in a Chevy Tahoe... Risks and challenges The risks of this project is that I might run out of money on tour, and it could be challenging. Another risk is that I might not deliver the prizes on time, but I will make sure to deliver it as soon as possible. I will make sure each person gets their promised rewards, it is my part as the creator of this project to deliver your prizes. Your guys funds are drastically going to make this tour possible and make it great for me to get exposure. The risks are low really, but the only concern might be delays in getting the merchandise, but I will make sure you get the stuff!!! F3tto Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
