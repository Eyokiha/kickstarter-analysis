According to our spectacular reviews we are ' the New Glyndebourne ' ! You can read all of them on the Winslow Hall Opera Website . It has been a tough journey for three years and this year we are delighted to bring La Traviata to Winslow . Our international cast received rave reviews last year and due to the british weather we are looking for funding for the performance marquee that seats 300 people . The opera is performed over 2 weeks , and yet it has been a year of planning and auditioning. Risks and challenges We have overcome many challenges over the last 3 years . Bringing a full orchestra together for a month of rehearsals and getting the chorus together for all costume fittings is just the beginning . International stars arriving at unknown airports expecting to be collected and demanding divas housed and fed . ( many many allergies and food intolerances ) but we have to look after them royally for the show must go on ! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
