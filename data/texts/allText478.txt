Where to begin? I started out as a small town boy, eager to conquer the world and carve my face into Mount Rushmore. Having fallen short of my world domination schemes, I decided to enter into the world of like minded aspiring evil masterminds.Media.Studying two years in Journalism at the University Of Queensland, I soon became enamored with the idea of creative writing and began my very own novel, and then another, and another.Now I am weighed down by the copious amounts of literary aspiration I harbor, and have not a single publication to show for it. This simply will not do.So, I have set my sights on YouTube, where mildly creative people can flourish and University students can vent all their pent up frustration.Did I say frustration? I meant imagination. Same thing really.And thus, we come to your part in this grand plan. You see, I have no film equipment, no platform from which to launch. I would humble ask of you, no, BESEECH of you, kind gentleperson, to pledge a pittance to my cause. Even the smallest amount will help and truly, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Risks and challenges YouTube is cut-throat and I won't lie, a little scary for a newcomer like me, but I'm trim, fit, slim and able. I won't fail you, I am the leaf in the wind, watch me soar. If that hasn't got you convinced, throw a couple dollars my way and watch me fail, it'll be funny, promise. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
