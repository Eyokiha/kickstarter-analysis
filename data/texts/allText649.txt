The 5 campervan awnings gives people looking for a freestanding awning which reaches upto 230cm high a perfect choice of sizes when it comes to a cool and quick to use awning. The BREEZE range fits all campervans such as Volkswagon, conversions and more. Rather than having fibreglass poles all BREEZE awnings are pump up! All BREEZE awnings supplied with pump. All BREEZE awnings supplied with Pump. Perfect for extra sleeping space, eating space or somewhere to change and/ or store everything such as surf boards, bikes, fishing kits, or even space suits.
