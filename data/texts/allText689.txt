I grew up dreaming about one day making an impact on the world via my writing, and creativity. With BSB I'm able to do just that! The products I create, educate, inform, and inspire! And, with the upgrades in equipment, I'll be able to create better products for more people. Risks and challenges I work with printers, shippers, and suppliers. And, sometimes it may be necessary to use an alternative. If so, I have compiled a list of reliable partners that I can call on to assist me to get products produced and shipped if my regular partners are unable to meet my timeline.
