For the past 2 years I have had the same dream about building a website for Christians that was comparable to Facebook or Twitter. This site will allow any type of Christian no matter their domination to come together as one. Churches will be able to create a page and have the ability to reach out to others. I have the knowledge to build such a site but do not have the means to start it. If successful I can have it running in less than a year. Risks and challenges This type of site is always an trial and error project although other than illness there shouldn't be much of a delay. The most difficult part is advertising but once it starts it should take off. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
