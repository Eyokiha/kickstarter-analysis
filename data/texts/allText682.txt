PulsePak in the News: What is PulsePak?PulsePak is an extremely small, smartphone battery charger that fits on your keychain to give you extra battery life in emergency situations. Whether you are waiting for an important email, needing to make a quick phone call, or simply keeping your phone charged in-spite of a demanding schedule, PulsePak will be there to keep you connected. Why PulsePak?Since you never plan on running out of battery, it is a huge pain when you do. However, we found that most mobile charging banks were too large to actually carry around with you on a daily basis. We feel that the ideal solution to this problem is a battery charger small enough to keep on your keychain that isn't a burden, yet there when you need it. We couldn't find a single product on the market that provided this level of convenience or quality, so we set out to create PulsePak. PulsePak has a built in micro usb connector that plugs straight into your phone. Battery LifeActual battery life depends on your device and usage. On phones with medium sized batteries such as the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One, PulsePak extends your battery life an average of 1.5 hours additional talk time. Larger phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 will benefit approximately an extra hour of talk time. Design ProcessWe designed PulsePak to be a simple, elegant power bank small enough to fit on your keychain. We focused on creating a sleek, minimalistic device. Through extensive prototyping, we were able to give PulsePak the optimal size and proportions to fit comfortably in your pocket, allowing it to enhance your everyday life. PulsePak will be manufactured using high quality electrical components. The housing is manufactured from aircraft grade aluminum, which provides exceptional build quality and maximizes durability. PulsePak's PCB includes all the necessary fail safes to ensure proper operation and longevity. We've completed countless prototypes and testing to ensure that PulsePak delivers the best mobile charging experience available. Specs Dimensions: 1.5 x .9 x .5 inches Weight: 20 grams 300mAh Lithium Polymer Battery 3-4 Month Standby Micro USB Input and Output 500+ Charge Cycles Production Plan We need your help to fund the tooling costs and our first production run. If you like this product, make sure to help us Kickstart PulsePak! Risks and challenges No technical risks as the PCB has been fully tested and its tooling has been finalized. Since so much work has already been done on this product, it is just a matter of finishing the tooling for the aluminum housing and going to production, which means that Pulsepak is nearly complete. Typically, tooling needs to be adjusted after it is completed to make sure that all parts fit together properly. We have accounted for time this takes in our schedule. There is always a risk in the manufacturing process to ensure high quality. To overcome this obstacle members of our team will be on site in China to oversee the first production run and ensure it meets our high quality standards. We have set a funding goal high enough to cover the remaining tooling costs and a minimum order so that we will have enough money to ensure backers receive their rewards. Overseas deliveries can sometimes be delayed if shipping companies are over capacity. When this happens it can not be avoided but we don't foresee this causing a delay greater than 1-2 weeks.
