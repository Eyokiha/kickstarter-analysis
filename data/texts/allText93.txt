I am looking to take 2 peoples special friends with me on my travels around the world next year.The 2 people will be drawn from a hat NOT the largest donations so any amount would be greatly appreciated.While on my travels i will find the greatest scenery, iconic buildings and use my keen eye to send you constant updates(via video and photo) on what your toy is up to. The trip will last around 12 months but i can send your teddy back at any point.Will also accept any foldable cardboard cut outs of yourself so long as you are sure they can endure the ride. I am also expecting someone (as this is the internet) to probably want to send me on my travels with something like a dildo. In this scenario i will keep to my word and you will receive photos.My trip will take me to India, asia, Australasia, north america, south america and africa. I also have a gopro so you can expect your friend to join me on bungee jumps and sky diving. I will also (with your permission) like to start a blog for everyone to keep up to date on these travels and would like to share these photos as i feel some of them will be hilarious!Please help me make this a reality :)Kindest regardsGordon x Risks and challenges Only risk would be that your item you wish for me to take away is extremely fragile. However I will be looking after any possessions that are not mine as if they were my child. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
