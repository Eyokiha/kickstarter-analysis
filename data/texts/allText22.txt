I will be exploring the south Devon coast and seaside towns. I want to capture the vibrant and colourful images of the seaside, to get a vintage feel to the images produced, so that it's like looking back through a photo album of a childhood seaside holiday. I will use a Dana,(yes Dana, not Diana) plastic lomo camera, and lomography 120 film. So there will be an element of surprise but also vibrant colour I love from lomography films. At the end of the project I hope to exhibit the project in a Devon gallery, and will also self publish a photobook of the project. I am therefore seeking funding to shoot the project and to pay for films and printing coasts and for exhibition space. If you can back this project or share with your friends, then you'll be rewarded with vibrant, colourful, fun, nostalgic images of the British seaside. I am an analogue photographer from Plymouth, UK. I have exhibited throughout the UK and a couple of times in the US. Why not check out my website at www.kerrygerdes.wordpress.com I'm also on twitter at www.twitter.com/kerry020 where I will keep you updated on all my photography related things! Risks and challenges There is always a risk with lomography film, and film photography, that you never really know what sort of shot your going to end up with, But I aim to take quite a few films worth of pictures to edit down into a finished project. The British weather is also unpredictable, I want a summery feel to them, but can't always bank on the British summer. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
