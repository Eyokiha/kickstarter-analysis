Our goals is simple. We want to create an outlet that will allow us to share our passion with as many people as possible. We want to go on tour and make a living doing what we LOVE, making music and spending time with our fans. In order to put ourselves on that path, we first need to hammer out our first full studio album. This alone will allow us to reach a larger amount of people because we will have something tangible to share our music at shows or to share with a program director at a local radio station or a manager for a reputable record label. If you believe in us, please consider a pledge. Every band on the radio right now have gotten to where they are from the support of their fans. I know we won't be famous over night if we raise the money for this album and video but, it will give us the ammunition we need to get into the fight and hold our ground until something happens. Thank you so much for your support!
