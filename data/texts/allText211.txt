We have been writing new material for our 3rd studio album for the past 3 years. While a few songs are now part of our regular live set, some have never seen the light of day, so to speak. We started recording the new material a few months ago and are getting reeeeally close to having all the parts done. Driving around the other day, listening to rather "rough" demo versions of our new songs (see video), it dawned on us that we were out of that scarce commodity, cash, needed to make these demos into real songs (like Pinochio into a real boy). Money-greenbacks are needed ahead of time to finish tracking, for studio time to mix the darn thing, have it mastered, and replicate the actual CD's, and in exchange we have some sweet, limited-edition stuff for anyone who wants to help us out. Our new album features all the founding members; Chris Doud, Taylor Webster, Willy Tea, Matt Cordano, and Aaron Burtch, as well as talented newcomer, Chandler Pratt. And, a few tracks will showcase our good pal and phenomenal dobro player, Mr. Michael Witcher. We really hope to get this project finished before our busy summer full of shows so that people have a new item to take home with them. Not only do your timely donations go to help speedily fund what we feel will be our best album yet, but the incentives for donating sweeten the whole deal and make it very worth your while. Please take a look-see and help us out however you can. Thank you. Sincerely, Chris, Taylor, Aaron, Willy, Matt and Chandler
