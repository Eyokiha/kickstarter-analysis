I want to develop a free, uncensored, social media site for adult users (18+ years of age) without censorship. Membership would be free, upon proof of age, shall be approved by Administrators.Members shall have to ability to post ANYTHING they wish.They can sell anything, providing that it is legal for them to do so. (No illegal drugs, no illegal weapons, no illegal services)I've had a few questions on this and I'll try to clarify it:IF you can legally sell something, of some service, in the U.S.A., then you would be free to post as such.You would be free to say anything you wished, post any pictures you wished, PROVIDING THAT THEY DON'T VIOLATE U.S. Laws.ie: No kiddie porn, no copyrighted material, no ads to "kill your ex-wife / ex-husband, etc..... Risks and challenges Risks - Unforeseen issues with Beta Testing, Hosting, and Bandwidth. Challenges - Build a fast, great site / service in a timely fashion and get it promoted.
