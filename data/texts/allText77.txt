This project is to get my parents on their honeymoon for their one year anniversary! They were finally married last year, August 7th and because of work and time issues, neither of them were able to get free to celebrate their union! Seriously not cool man! This year, after a lot of struggle, a lot of planning, and some unexpected illnesses and a medical battle for health, they're finally getting to take the honeymoon they deserve!So, now you're wondering just how am I sitting here and writing all this if my parents only just married? Easy enough, my biological father found his soul mate shortly after moving to Oklahoma. Something about that man seemed to spark an equal interest in my new mother, and here they are, some time later and happily married.They're amazing people who really do deserve the best in life. She even took care of him when he had his hip replaced for the second time! Not many people would be willing to sit with a man trying to call them every name in the book while he was doped up on morphine. He's my dad and I wouldn't! I could go on for hours about the things I've seen occur between them, but at the end of the night... They truly love one another with all their hearts. It's such a rare thing in this world, why not give them a much needed break from real life? Risks and challenges Some of the risks here are obviously them finding out. Not raising any money for them to be able to actually make the trip, or any unforeseen circumstances that may occur on the road trip itself. Of course, they are taking every precaution to make sure the car is up for the trip, but who's to say something won't happen? This is the second attempt at a road trip anywhere and they're having a hard time believing that it's even possible! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
