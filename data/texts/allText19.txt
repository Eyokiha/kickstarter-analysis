The book has already been written, but requires 1000$ to be admitted to any e-book store. 1899$ will turn the book into a physical book through Zondervan publishing. I spent seven years writing, and many more in study, translating the whole text from the Greek just for my own reading, and reading the commentaries and hearing the preachers as I was able. The perspective is non-denominational and unique due to philosophy. My previous publications, as on Hamlet in Interpretation, show my work. Risks and challenges Mailing the books may be the hardest part. Editing is a joy, though, as an old academic writer in our society, mere subsistence is a challenge. I live on about half the poverty level, with debt from my studies still to be paid, perhaps by this book, or my next one, on music lyrics.
