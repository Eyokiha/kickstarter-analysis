The Long and Short...I'm giving this thing 40 days to raise 8,000 dollars. Watch the video above and check out some acoustic performances at youtube.com/skybreak4. I would love to make these rough performances into something monumental! But I need you! Help me complete this album by becoming a donor. Choose from the packages here and contribute.Here's the catch though.... We only have 40 days to hit our target of $8,000. If we are not successful, your credit card will not be charged and I won't get anything. But if we reach our big goal, your credit card will be charged at the closure of successful completion of this campaign and some new art will enter the world. Since I am not on any label, I'm going commando here and need every dollar to reach this goal. I hope Black & Blue becomes more than me just singing in my living room, I hope it becomes you listening to these sweet tunes in YOUR living room! Please join with me in this process and let's do this together!Blessings,Tyler Risks and challenges Once we have the funds the real work begins. We will enter the studio and what has been in my head for the past year or so will come rushing out. I appreciate your patience and support ahead of time for helping us get to this point. To be able to make a project that isn't completely recorded in my bedroom(closet,bathroom), and other rooms in my house is an amazing thing that not a lot of artist get a shot at. I NEED YOU!
