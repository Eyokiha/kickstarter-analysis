The songs are written. The music is already being recorded in the studio with fantastic musicians and producers. The hard part is convincing people that as listeners, they are not only deeply appreciated by me and my crew, but are our life force. We just want to share the reason we are here on Earth with ya'll. ~Mysti Mayhem~ Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
