I have been making photographs of scenic gravel roads and roadside haunts just off the road. This summer (as soon as things green up around here) I will be photographing most of the mountain bike trails in and around the Twin Cities Metro area. The reason for this project is that I need a way to make actual prints and cards from these images. These cards will make great gravel registration postcards! In the meantime, I have been outsourcing printing but it is expensive, paper choices (sizes and types) are limited and it is very inconvenient. I need a printer. Funds from this project will go towards a professional wide format inkjet printer that will give prints longevity, give me freedom and allow very quick turnaround times for you. Thank you for your interest,Rob Risks and challenges It is pretty straightforward here. I am an experienced photographer and printer. The main thing will be for me to continue making photographs that interest and inspire you. For the large $100 contribution the biggest thing will be finding a day/location with the right weather but we'll communicate and work together on it. I will continue to update my Etsy store so you will have a wide variety of images to choose from. Note not all images will be available as prints due to the larger format but I will have a wide variety to choose from. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
