Having grown up around the Delaware River, I have a great respect and love of its amazing beauty. I've rafted, canoed, kayaked, tubed, swam, and body surfed the river. My high school/college summer job was on the river. I met my husband because of the Delaware River. I LOVE this river! And, as a photographer, I would like to share some of my love of the river with others. I believe the best way to achieve this is through a calendar: 12-13 of the best shots I have in me from all four seasons.I know this river and I know how to capture its beauty but not all of my equipment is ideal for the task. Part of my project includes an upgrade in camera, specifically, the Nikon D-7100. Ideally, I would upgrade my zoom lens to the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S, but I have not included that in my calculations as it is very expensive and I can make do with my current lens or rent.As part of the project, I want to offer the calendars for less than what they will cost to make. I print through high quality companies because there is no other way for the perfect moment or place to be shared. The funds raised here will cover the cost of printing, the Nikon D-7100 with warranty, and, ideally, the lens. Risks and challenges One of the challenges I face is that I no longer live near the Delaware River. As a working mom of two little girls, it will be a challenge to get to the river and get the shots I have in mind. That said, I am determined for my girls to enjoy the river as I have and believe this project will be a way for them to see some of my favorite places. I also believe seeing the river through their eyes will help me reach new levels as a mom and photographer. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
