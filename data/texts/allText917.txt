Hi. US Emergency.org is an initiative which only you can make possible. Born as a free service, it helps to save millions of lives of American people by providing vital information on emergency situations.Everyday thousands of people across the country are treated on emergency situations by EMTs, paramedics, hospitals & colleagues. The survival rate on this situations increases heavily when sensitive health information is available at that precise moment.Current fatalities occur due the lack of information caused by ignoring blood type, is person's specific medical condition or even by providing medication that causes a mortal reaction to another medication that the patient is currently taking.This information is provided immediately as needed through our application increasing the efficiency of assistance. Here we explain how it works.Thank you for joining and making this happen!Sincerely,The US Emergency Registry Staff In order to assist a person in an efficient way, there is certain medical information required, such as: So far so good?Let's take a look on how the service works: How much does this cost to people?Nothing, it's free for everyone.Your cooperation will enable us to provide this service for free for over 400'000,000 Americans, which is the estimate of population on the year 2050. Risks and challenges The real risks and challenges we face don't lie in completing this project, but in the problems that we'll face without it. If we raise our minimum funding goal, we do not anticipate ANY significant challenges or risks in completing the project. As with all Kickstarter projects, there is always a risk of delay in delivering some of the rewards, but we've been careful to give ourselves MORE time than we think we'll need â€“ so we hope we'll have some, or all, of the rewards out SOONER than listed.
