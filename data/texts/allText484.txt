this is my first feature film "friendship and trust" which i started writing just before i started universty.the film is based in Luton and we will be using as much local talent as possiable. (actors, crew menbers, musicians and companies involed in the project).as a film auter i wish to create my own unquie style of film making using my own ideas and thoughts on filming techniques. this film will allow me to test these ideas even further.the main cast and crew incudling myself are working for a deferred payment (a percentage of the profits made on the production)the Â£10,000 budget will be used to purchase/hire the esstial props, make up and equitment required for filming as well as esssential expencsess for the cast and crew (which inculdes travel, acommodation and food and drinks for the cast and crew whilst filming) almost all the pre-production is complete. script, actors, locations are ready.we still have a couple of locations to find which we are getting help from some well know letting/property agents (S.R Woods to name one).also there are a few minor roles in the production still to cast.production of the film will start after 3 weeks of read throughs and rehersals, and then filming over 9 weeks (3-5 days per week) and then any re-shoots required pioror to editing which will take up to 12-16 weeks to complete. Risks and challenges some of the obstacles we will come across whilst filming are conternewerty. so will we have a contueneity editor on set as well as having photos and lists of what the actors are wearing, hair styles, make up, etc. re-shoots for scenes which time and days have being set aside during filming to do them if they are required.
