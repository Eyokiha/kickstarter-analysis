Ever since I was diagnosed with Cancer I have been fighting with collecting useful and helpful information for those with Cancer.This was mission impossible from day one. I have since found numerous resources that mainly lead to more numbers and more sites, pretty much leading nowhere.Most people with Cancer have little time or patience for all of this and when the end of the mission to receive assistance or while trying to find a general starting point ends in a mystery find themselves frustrated and more confused than they started.Well, I will aim higher with a link to resources I found and speak out with others to show them the way to their answers.A guided hand is always more helpful than a phone number. The user will be able to join as someone willing to volunteer their time to helpOr as someone with questions seeking help from people like myself and volunteers.It isn't inexpensive to run a site that will be hosted to also provide bandwidth supporting video chat.This is why I am here, asking for your help. Design is easy. Hosting costs thousands every year. It is hard to put a price on such a subject, but that is where my answers have stopped with dead ears.I was unable to find any company willing to donate their services for this cause. I hope Kickstarter will be able to make this happen.God Bless us all! =) Risks and challenges As I stated earlier, Design is easy. I have years of programming skill. I pretty much rely on it as a hobby now after being diagnosed while on treatment. The only obstical now is a financial start. I am sure donations will pour in once the site gets its own legs and the views of some helpful volunteers. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
