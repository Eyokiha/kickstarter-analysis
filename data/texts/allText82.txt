Thailand off trackIn this exciting project (for us anyway!) a Greek photographer, an English writer and a Thai project Manager will travel from the north to the south of Thailand to document Thai life and get to the places mainstream tourism and travel miss. We will tell the stories of the real lives of the people we meet, and visit some outstanding locations.We will combine photography, blog, poetry, landscape art and video. Our aim is to experience not just observe, to help people where we can. We will work with them to tell their own stories, and make their own unique contributions to the project.We are committed to responsible travel, being mindful of our impact on the local environment and culture, and treating people with fairness and respect. We will try to learn from Thai culture â€“ to see more through Thai eyes, to be more mindful, and to see the fun in daily life.We will end the project with an exhibition and a travel book to take people beyond the standard picture of Thailand. The use of different media will aim to bring people closer to our experience. Risks and challenges The risk in "off track travel" is that we face many unknowns as we are not in a pre-organised package. We need to follow leads and stories, we don't know where we will be staying all of the time, our funds are limited and we hope to earn some money along the way. In some places we will help for free in return for accommodation and food. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
