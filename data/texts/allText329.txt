Join the Proppa Pack Today!Update#1 - Android Vertical SliceHello Kickstarters, thank you for your early support! It's Spring Break time here in Chicago, the weather is crazy warm, and we're working hard on Proppa!Here is a vertical slice of an early development build running on a few Android devices. A vertical slice is a cross-section showing off the critical game systems and important art. We use an iterative process, which means that everything is always being worked on and improved -- so please bear with us as we smooth out the rough edges. This new video also shows the first build of the new "blue world". We will show you the iPhone and iPad versions in the next updates. The game looks and plays great on the Kindle Fire! Thanks again for your support and spread the word,- The Proppa Pack Introduction Hello Kickstarters! We have a great team of students, led by a game development professor and industry veteran, making a fun game for mobile phones and tablets. The game is called Proppa, and the objective is to help the Proppas collect their eggs and survive attacks by the evil snakes. Save The Proppas Proppas are happy creatures who live in a magical land. They spend most of their time flying and you can make them fly by tapping the green Proppas. The blue Proppas don't move as fast, and you'll have to rub them to get them to fly. Every year they travel to their spawning area to hatch their eggs and collect their young. This time, they were followed by the evil snakes. The snakes are trying to kill the Proppas and eat their eggs. Help the Proppas collect their eggs and survive attacks by the evil snakes. The challenge increases as the number of Proppas and snakes increases. Watch out for the fast dragon snakes with big teeth! We currently have three worlds -- the red, yellow and blue worlds -- and are building waves within each world. The game got its start at the Global Game Jam 2012. Technology Proppa uses a set of tools and engine, developed by Professor Linhoff, that allow us to develop Proppa primarily on the PC. From there, we compile it fairly easily as a native app for the different target platforms. Meet The Propeller People Pictured from left to right: Joe Scalzo, Brian Gabor, Jr., Joscelyn Stephens, Professor Noriko Tomuro, Professor Joe Linhoff, Green Proppa, Yuko Ito, and Misaki Ohira. Our team is based on an international collaboration with most of the design and programming done in Chicago, and most of the art done in Nagoya, Japan. Professor Noriko Tomuro makes the collaboration possible and is our life-line to these talented Japanese student artists. A ProblemWe have a small team of talented and hard-working students who are graduating this year. All of them have focused their undergraduate studies on game development. All of them are looking for their first job.These soon-to-be graduates face the daunting task of breaking into the game industry, unpaid internships and all. It's rough.The SolutionWith your help, these students will bridge the gap between the end of school and the start of their careers as game developers. The best thing they can do now, is create and publish a successful game. Proppa can be that game!Proppa is a great game for many reasons. Here are a few. First, it has great art and great characters done in a fanciful Japanese style. The art style and game appeals to a wide range of players.Second, the game is not a big game in terms of design. It is, in a sense, a small game that everyone can wrap their heads around. We have a well-defined set of assets and a schedule. The game is not open ended.Third, we have a fun, playable prototype (see the link below) which was created over one short weekend at the 2012 Global Game Jam.Finally, we are fairly far along in the development of the real game, and things are looking good. For example, an early version of the real game is running on the iPad, iPhone, Kindle Fire, Droid X, and PC.We Need Your SupportSo, while things are ramping up, we need help to grow Proppa from something we love and find the time to work on, to something we love and to which we can devote our full attention. For a short time, the students need to be able to focus on Proppa without job worries, and your support will help make that possible.The mobile game space presents incredible opportunity, but success requires more than just a good game. We need funding to get this game to as large an audience as possible.Beyond the bare minimum support, we have ideas to make Proppa a bigger and better game. For example, in addition to more worlds and waves, we want to add baby Proppas to the game. They are cute, but when they hatch, they can not fly, and need your help as they cling to their parent Proppas. This will add another game mechanic and dimension to the game and also lengthen development past our bare minimum.As the video states, this team is good and has great potential. Our dream Kickstarter would allow us to extend Proppa, and support work on another game. Holding the team together, including Yuko and Misaki in Japan, means that we will continue to make great games and do what we love.As a side note, while there are students and faculty from the schools, this project is not affiliated with DePaul University or Trident College.Linux & Mac VersionsIf you are a supporter, and would like a Linux or Mac version, let us know. If 50 or more of our supporters, at any level, request Linux or Mac support, we'll add support for that system and fill the "Windows PC" reward with a Linux or Mac version as you specify. Please allow an additional month.Support RoadmapWe need Kickstarter support to get Proppa into the app stores. We need funding to help set up a company, pay for business expenses, legal fees, licenses, and development costs. $5000 is the bare minimum the team needs to finish a kind of Spring Proppa, with 3 worlds, 2 Proppas, enemies, and the happy and angry clouds! If we surpass $5000, we will work on the Summer Proppa update to bring you even more Proppa! We plan on adding 3 new worlds with many waves, the baby Proppa, friendlies, and more. Our goal is to finish the update early this Summer. We're asking for your support. The future is wide open, we will be making great games! Thank You!Thank you for taking the time to consider our project.
