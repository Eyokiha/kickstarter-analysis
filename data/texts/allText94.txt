We are a young couple that has sent out to explore the beauty in what some call ruins. We seek abandoned cities, buildings, amusement parks or anything that has been forgotten. We've been many place and taken many pictures but all have been local. Our hope are to travel all over America and help show the world the beauty you can find in something some call dead. Risks and challenges The risks we run in to are making it to places before they're demolished. We will run into many problems along the way as we already have but will rise above them. Funding is our largest issue. We need the airfare and equipment to get the best quality photos. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
