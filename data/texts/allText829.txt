Help fund my campaign to launch a new company that aims towards innovating how high schools, colleges and universities connect! Coming from the field of higher education, I have found that there is no product or service available for what I am trying to develop. I am seeking funding to develop a website that gives education professionals access to a database of up to date and important contact information. There is a high demand for this type of product and it will provide ease of communication and more accessibility to key staff members that are gearing students towards successful enrollment at a higher education institution.Funding for this project will be dedicated towards website purchases, development and design, business licenses and a few start-up marketing materials. I am asking only for what is absolutely necessary to get this business up and running, but because I am in the education field, my funds are limited and need help getting this great idea off the ground! Your support is needed, upon successful funding I plan to participate in Kicking it Forward to help other crowdfunding ventures like mine. Risks and challenges Challenges of this start up will be in the technical development of the website. The funds for this project are a necessity to purchase the required software to make the website and database both functional and user friendly. Aggregating the information and maintaining accuracy for the database on a national scale will require more work and will have to hire seasonal employees to complete the tasks. This will not be an issue as the business begins to scale and acquires more subscribers. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
