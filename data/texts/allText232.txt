The goal of this song is, to enlighten the general American public to the values of being a Republican. Many think that Republican's are racist and against the betterment of their fellow Americans and do not believe in worthy causes. The Republican Party, Abolished slavery, promoted free speech and women's suffrage. These are all stances the Republican Party, in opposition to the Democratic Party, adopted early on. We need to remind people what is to be an American. To work hard and to be rewarded for your efforts. To have the desire and self fortitude to put yourself or children through college, to work for a better life so you and your family and friends can enjoy a UT, Georgia rivalry. The pride of knowing that you accomplished the American dream on your own accord. The joy of strumming an ol' guitar. Having a son, daughter, sister or brother go to war and seeing that love one come home. This song represents what America is and will always be as a country. We fight to protect our liberties we build each other up with family vaues. Not by taking advantage of our fellow American by leaching off the welfare system. Given the nature of the economy, it is understandable that one of us may need a helping hand. But that does not mean that that individual has to take the whole body. This song is meant to remind the Democrats that our values and beliefs are the American way. That we don't need to have the government control every facet of our lives. We will raise the funds to have a great American country singer, like Le Ann Rimes, sing the song and get it put on as many media outlets as possible. America is still home to me and so is the Republican Party and our values. And we plan on keeping it that way, by electing a man of principal and values. So please, listen to this song and read the lyrics and let's help make this a reality.
