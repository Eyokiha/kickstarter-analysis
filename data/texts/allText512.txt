THE STORYTake off tells the story of a young boy who uses his vivid imagination to escape the reality of his troubled life. With absent parents and no friends, his only escape has been the world he creates inside his head. One day, he rides his bike into a park where he comes across an eccentric, offbeat man who also uses his imagination to get through life. The boy follows the man into his creative world, where he has assembled everyday trash to resemble a "rocket ship". The two form a unique bond and escape the realities of their worlds.
