What is HandEnergy?HandEnergy is your pocket electricity generator. Everyone knows what low battery means: we are disconnected from the world! And sometimes there’s no way to charge your battery when you urgently need it. Now you can forget about this problem, as you would always have your own generator with you. Generate your own clean energy with the power of your body; store it, always keep it with you, and charge your devices wherever you are. Forget about your battery running out. Be independent from the electricity grid and don’t waste your time looking for a socket. Featured on How HandEnergy works? First, start HandEnergy by winding the starter ring. Release the starter ring. That will transmit an impulse to the rotor. Rotate your HandEnergy with your wrist to keep the rotor spinning. Average speed 5000 RPM. The magnetic rotor transmits mechanical power to the stator and produce an electric current, charging the built-in batteries. USB Output 5V 1A What kind of devices can you charge? What makes HandEnergy special? Be independent Always With You Energy Problem Solution Efficiency Eco-Friendly Energy Resource Exercise—Physical activity Electric current What people say about HandEnergy? Tech Specs What about speed of charging?HandEnergy has the same current as when you charge devices from the socket. However to charge the battery of HandEnergy by rotating takes a bit longer due to lower current from generation. HandEnergy Mobile App and CommunityThe HandEnergy app allows you to track your generation and share it with your friends. By joining the HandEnergy community, you can compete with others and see how the real dynamo machine works to reduce the use of fossil fuels. The HandEnergy app is a great thing for mobile games developers: now we can really use our physical power while playing. Styles & DesignYou may choose a Hand Energy device according to your taste. Our design covers a wide colour range and includes some limited editions, too. It will be very easy to find something that matches your style. HandEnergy development and the TeamWe are a group of enthusiasts with a technical background. Our speciality is the production and maintenance of industrial electricity generators. Looking at these huge things, we came up with the idea to make it small so that people can use it in everyday life. We have tested dozens of options to ascertain how a man can best transform body muscle power into electricity, while keeping in mind that it has to be small, portable and cool. The result of this is HandEnergy. Meet The Team #HandEnergyTourBefore this campaign, we made a #HandEnergyTour around Europe to show our product to the people. We visited 15 cities in nine countries during two weeks, where we gave hundreds of people the HandEnergy to test, asking their feedback. Now we are sure that people truly want this device! Let us thank all of you for your ideas and support. Our Timeline Rewards Why we need your helpWe have been working on HandEnergy for more than a year now, and to move further we need to use professional equipment, some customised spare parts, and a variety of the best plastics and metal alloys. We need your support to get access to all these resources, to realise the production plan and to make the world energy-safer for you. Our MissionToday, we can’t imagine our lives without mobile devices and all of them need to be charged. We want to help people to be independent from the power grid, or at least to have an emergency source of energy. We are passionate about producing clean energy and HandEnergy is our contribution to that. We believe our HandEnergy will help people in developing countries with poor electricity coverage to be closer to the internet and education by having their smartphones always on. We will work with United Nations to bring this idea to live. Follow us Risks and challenges Every technology start up has a risk that something will go wrong. Mass production is a challenge compared to hand-made prototypes produced from the parts like batteries and chips easily available in the market. For you we will order custom made parts to improve the quality, reliability and performance of our HanEnergy. Delay of parts and components is the major risk and that’s why we try to place orders in our country to be able monitor the situation on a daily basis. We have done our study and pre-negotiations with a number of trusted producers which have huge experience producing consumer goods. Worldwide shipping is another risk though our team is experienced in global logistics and sales. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
