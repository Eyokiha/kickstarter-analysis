My major in college is History. I'm wanting to write and publish an all-inclusive book on ancient Greece. I am wanting to travel to various museums around the globe, as well as other places, and take current high resolution photographs of archaeological finds and historical locations. As I am barely surviving on what is left of my GI Bill, do not have a family, and do not have a place of my own to live.. funding for such a project is impossible. I plan on using this project for my graduate studies and, hopefully, I will earn a little bit of money from sales. I have received financial aid for my travels and one of my professors has friends in various countries that are willing to provide lodging. I simply need funds for the equipment. Risks and challenges I need funding for both the equipment and insurance to cover it in case of an accident. The total cost of the equipment which includes the Canon 5D Mark III, two lenses that were recommended to me by local photographers, and a backpack for transport.. comes to $7,585 on B&H.
