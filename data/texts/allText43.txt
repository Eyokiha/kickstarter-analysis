I am raising funds to create a photo book of historical European castles. To properly do my research I want to hear folklore about the castles from locals and take tours of the inside to add photos and descriptions to the already stunning castles. Each of these beauties already has an intriguing back story, but it's the inner tales that really bring them to life. I want to tell the tales of who lived inside the castles, not just of the structures themselves. I plan to go on tours, interview locals, tour guides, and historians, to find out the details of what happened inside those walls. Risks and challenges A foreseeable challenge after the information and photos are gathered and the book is designed is production delays from my busy life and everyone involved. But we are all willing to focus on this project to get it fulfilled. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
