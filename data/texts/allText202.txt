We have all been in bands prior to this. We feel that this is the one that really pulls us together with a musical sense of maturity. This project has brought us so much support from our hometown and even more from towns away. Completing this record is our number one focus right now and this is the time we need help the most. We are truly grateful for what we have accomplished so far and we're confident that it may be the door to reaching our dreams. Risks and challenges As we have said, either way, donations or not, we're going to finish this record and we believe enough in ourselves to get it done the right way.
