“Never leave that till tomorrow, which you can do today” -Benjamin Franklin. The innovation behind our application is to build exactly on this concept. Four students were sitting around trying to schedule a time when they could meet up for a group project. It was a very stressful situation because any time a student suggested when they could meet together, another student shot it down. Finally a student illuminated “I wish there was an app for this” and the idea behind our app was born. We decided to come up with an app that will sync our school, work, and personal calendars together between us to find the limited free time we could all meet together. Our approach to creating this app was to make it marketable to people of all ages and make it especially useful in the business world. Our expectations are endless for this app. Just like any great idea it keeps building and building on itself to improve its efficiency. We came up with the name “PlanIt” for the app, which makes a lot of sense if you look into it. People with linked schedules will be known to be on the same ‘planet’ as each other and there will be several planets a single person could be on depending on who their schedule is linked with. This ties in with the modern technology of the ‘cloud’. PlanIt also is a play on words referring to the obvious scheduling of plans with each other. Our tagline is to ‘Get on your PlanIt’ which again is a play on words. With PlanIt you will always be able to get the most out of your daily schedule and never leave that till tomorrow, which could be accomplished today. Risks and challenges Risks that we have had to overcome so far is finding the right funding goal. With our funding goal of $50,000 we need to fulfill the whole amount or else we won't receive any of it. Finding an app developer has also been tough, one who sees our vision and wants to work with us pretty much every single day for 4 months. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
