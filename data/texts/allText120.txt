Ive been working on Ciervos for about four years now and really think I have what it takes at this point to put my skills to the test in a studio. From this point on Ive managed to buy a crappy mic and keyboard to make what you've heard in the video or on the website. I have a friend that can give me 30hr in a great studio for a steal and would love the chance to get my music out to anyone that can enjoy it. The money will go towards paying for studio time and paying for some recording equipment such as a interface and software. The final Album will have 12 tracks on it. The song you heard in the video attached with this project is called "Don't Over Do It" and will be mastered in the studio so its extra juicy when you get it on your CD! If you have spent any time on this page at all I'd like to thank you for your time.Denlin.Check out the website below and to the right for more music.Thanks so much to the first two backers!!!
