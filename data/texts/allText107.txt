I am raising funds to expand my small business slowly! These funds will cover the cost of a photographic canvas as a reward to you! The prints are taken by myself on a 36 mega pixel Nikon D800 camera with superb quality. There is a local theme of images from Sussex taken locally by myself. The canvas print will be shipped to you in time for Christmas, Ideal for a present! You may choose the canvas print of your choice from my gallery.
