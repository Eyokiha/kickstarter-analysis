Quote from Barry Ladendorf, President, Veterans For Peace The music video “Extremists for Peace” that Pat Scanlon, Willie Sordillo (music producer) and Chuck Green (Emmy award winning film maker) are making is a wonderful project that Veterans For Peace is behind 100%. The song is upbeat, with an important message, and hundreds of VFP members from across the country will be actual participants in recording the song and making the music video. Please support this project.Message from Pat ScanlonDear Friends,I hope you watched the short video above. It tells the story of our “Extremists for Peace” Music Video Project in a nut-shell. We need your help to make this music video and its message a reality. We hope you will consider making a generous donation to this project. We would be “extremely” grateful. Some of Boston's best musicians are donating their time and talents to record the song. Chuck Green an Emmy Award winning filmmaker will be producing the video. Chuck produced our previous video, “War is Not the Answer”. To see the quality please go to: www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFRgEQGIDzs Pat & Holly Veterans For Peace chapter members from around the country will be in the video singing the chorus. This video will be distributed around the world through all 140 VFP chapters and social media. It will be excellent exposure for Veterans For Peace and for the very important message of the song. Funding the project:Recording the song and making the music video, “Extremists for Peace” is going to be expensive. We estimate $9,000.00 for recording, mixing, mastering the song plus filming and editing the actual music video. Different VFP chapters around the country will be filmed singing the chorus. We are hoping to be able to produce a companion CD of the same name. This will cost an estimated additional $6,000.00, for a total estimated cost of $15,000.00. We are only asking for $6,500.00 through our Kickstarter campaign. Please help fund our "Extremists for Peace" Music Video Project. Donations of any amount will be appreciated.

We are actually an international organization with chapters now in London, England and Vietnam. We have over 140 chapters across the country with approximately 3,000 members. Our mission is simple. “As veterans who have dutifully and honorably served our nation, many having experienced the horrors of war, now work for world peace. We educate on the true costs of war and work to end the arms race and seek non-violent peaceful solutions to conflicts. We support the abolition of nuclear weapons and seek justice for veterans and victims of war”. Military and Personal Biography:I have been a peace and environmental activists for the past forty-five years, ever since returning from Vietnam in 1970. I was in Vietnam for the year of 1969. I was an Intelligence Analyst, a graduate of the U.S, Army Intelligence School at Fort Holabird, Maryland and held a Top Secret clearance. While in Vietnam I was at MACV (Military Assistance Command Vietnam) headquarters in Saigon, Targets Division for B52 strikes. I personally did the Bomb Damage Assessment for all the B52 strikes in South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during the entire year of 1969. I was in the upper echelons of military command. General Abrams, the Commanding General was at the end of my hallway. Just to give you some perspective. During that time frame, just the one-year of 1969, from only B52s, we dropped over 3 ½ million bombs in South Vietnam and over another ¼ million bombs in Laos and Cambodia. During the war in Vietnam, over 3 million Vietnamese were killed, 2 million by the air campaign. I was an integral part of that campaign. Ever since my return from Vietnam I have been trying to pay back the Universe for what I participated in. For the past twelve years or so I have been an active member of Veterans For Peace and our local chapter, Smedley D. Butler Brigade here in Boston. For over five years I served as the Coordinator of our chapter and one year as our Vice Coordinator. The Smedleys, as we are known, is one of the largest and most active chapters in the country. I have a wonderful family with Connie my wife and two exceptional children, Janis and David. I have worked in the recycling field for about forty years. I founded a statewide recycling coalition in Massachusetts called MassRecycle and served on the Board of Directors of the National Recycling Coalition for five years. I have also served on the BOD of several other environmental and recycling organizations. Musical Background: I never had any musical training as a kid growing up in Philadelphia. This was not an option in my overcrowded Catholic grade and high school. I may not have played an instrument, but I always loved music, especially acoustic music. For many years I went to folk festivals and blue grass festivals all over New England. I also camped at the Philadelphia Folk Festival for several years. I especially loved the banjo. If there was a band playing with a banjo I was all ears. Pete Seeger was one of my musical heros and inspirations. I met Pete on several occasions. My wife Connie and I actually had the opportunity to visit Pete at his home in Beacon, NY. We often communicated with each other by mail. It was not until post-Vietnam and college that a friend bought me a banjo. I took ten lessons, learned some basics and I was off and running. At that time I was an organizer for a group known as the Clamshell Alliance, opposing the construction of the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant. The first song I ever wrote was, “Standing Here Together”. This was an anti-nuclear power song that I wrote while at the same time organizing a major rally at Seabrook. The second song I wrote was actually a poem I had written much earlier entitled, “Decorated Viet Vet” and put to a simple tune and plucked on my banjo. That was the start and shortly there after I found myself playing at anti-nuclear and peace rallies from Philly to Maine, from Seabrook to Three Mile Island. Hiroshima Day - Cambridge, MA In 1984 I recorded four songs on an EP (extended play mini record) with my friends in the Blackwater String Band from Concord New Hampshire. The songs were part of a non-profit, volunteer educational project in partnership with seven anti-nuclear, environmental and peace groups including the environmental group Greenpeace. The songs and literature from all those groups were packaged and sent to over 2,000 people around the country. On a whim we sent one of the packages to Rounder Records, in Cambridge Mass. A few weeks later I received a phone call from the owners of Rounder saying they liked what we were singing about and liked our sound and asked if I would be able to expand what I had sent them to a full album. I quickly said yes. They replied, “come on down. We would like to sign you to a contract”. It was that easy, I was totally flabbergasted. Here I was, a basic banjo strumming fledging singer song-writer, not able to read a note of music and a record label wanted to sign me to a contract. Greenpeace enjoyed being part of our first project and when I told them that Rounder Records wanted to sign me to a contract and I asked them if they would like to stay with the project and co-sponsor a full album they didn't hesitate to agree to be part of the project. My first album on Rounder Records was entitled, “Songs for Future Generations”, recorded with the Blackwater String Band and co-sponsored by Greenpeace. I have four additional CD recordings, “We Can Do It”, “Where is the Rage”, “Blue State Liberal”, and “Songs of Peace, Kennebunkport”. I describe my music as being folk with a bluegrass flavor and a pinch of Irish. A full musical biography, "Banjo Picking Folky" can be found under the Bio tab.Past Music Video Project – “War is Not the Answer”Chuck Green an Emmy Award winning filmmaker made our first music video: “War is Not the Answer”. I wrote that song on the 30th Anniversary of John Lennon’s death. You can find that video on Youtube. Please click on the link below to see the content and quality of that music video production. War is Not the Answer, “Never Was, Never Will” Please click and visit: www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFRgEQGIDzsNew Music Video Project – “Extremists for Peace”We are now embarking on a new musical project and we need your help to make it happen. Chuck Green is the producer of our “Extremists for Peace” music video. My music has never been about making money. On the contrary, all of my musical endeavors have been non-profit. My music, in the best Pete Seeger tradition, is all about the message. Any money that was ever made was always put back into making music, or donated to organizations associated with the projects. “Where is the Rage” and “Songs of Peace, Kennebunkport” were both funded through donations from Veterans For Peace chapters, friends, and members of Boston area peace groups. Our music video, “War is Not the Answer” was also funded through donations. Memorial Day - VFP Event History on the origins of the song “Extremists”After 9/11 our government created what are known as “Fusions Centers”, formally known as Regional Intelligence Centers, around the country to facilitate the gathering of intelligence. There are now 75 Regional Intelligence Centers (RICs) covering every state. There are two here in Massachusetts, one in western Mass and one in Boston, known as the BRIC, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center. This particular center is located at the Boston Police Headquarters in Boston. The Massachusetts ACLU and the National Lawyers Guild wanted to find out what was the extent of surveillance of the peace groups in Boston by the Boston Police. Initially they simply asked the Boston Police and were ignored. So they filed a Freedom of Information request that was also ignored. Then they sued the Boston Police in Federal Court. As Coordinator of the Boston Chapter of Veterans For Peace I was personally named as a plaintiff in the case as was our chapter. Mass Peace Action and Code Pink were also plaintiffs. As a result of filing that lawsuit the ACLU and NLG received a lot of materials; films, tapes and reports. (see the final report: Policing Dissent at: https://aclum.org/app/uploads/2015/06/reports-policing-dissent.pdf A few of us spent a couple of hours in the ACLU offices reviewing some of the films and reading reports. One report in particular brought me to a standstill. This report began by describing our organization. It started with “Veterans For Peace, an Extremist Organization”, Blah, Blah, Blah. I became fixated on that statement and to be honest I never read the Blah, Blah, Blah part. We know who the Extremist Organizations are and they certainly are not Veterans For Peace. I went home that afternoon and wrote the song “Extremists”. Chorus:They call us all Extremists, cause we’re out here in the street How unpatriotic ---- Veterans For PeaceThey say, we gotta watch them like never beforeCause there’s nothing more dangerous than Veterans Against War.Since writing the song I haven’t done anything with it. I had no plans to go back into the studio. All my free time for the past six to seven years has been dedicated to our chapter of Veterans For Peace, so my music lay pretty dormant. In fact I had only publicly performed this song once and it was not even a completed version at that time. Recently, Barry Ladendorf, the President of Veterans For Peace flew in from San Diego to participate in an anti-Islamophobia event our chapter held at the largest Mosque in New England here in Boston. While staying at my house I had the opportunity to play him my song “Extremists". Barry loved the song and immediately began encouraging me to do something with it. We discussed what it would take to record it and possibly make it into a music video. That is how our "Extremists for Peace" Music Video Project began. Barry would like the music video to be ready for the Veterans For Peace National Convention in California this coming August. In order for that to happen, a lot has to be put together. The first thing we need to do is raise the funds to record, mix and master the song. We intend on having fifty or so members of Veterans for Peace and friends singing on the chorus. Once it is all recorded, mixed and mastered we will then Chuck Green will perform his magic by producing a first rate film of the highest quality. We will include chapters from across the country in the video. This is going to be a lot of fun and will take a lot of work, but we can do it. We just need everyone to do his or her part. The second thing we hope to accomplish is to be able to produce a companion music CD. This CD will contain some new songs, some songs that never were on a CD, such as "War is Not the Answer" and "On the Line" and some songs from past recordings. It would have 16 songs in total. Our super reach for this project is to make a two disc CD that would contain the best songs from all our recordings. This would contain 30 songs.Thank you for your support. Pat Scanlon (VN 69’)Veterans For Peace Risks and challenges One risk is that we are going to be filming five chapters around the country. We may run into problems getting them filmed properly. We actually have one or more scheduled than we actually need. We can always drop one of them. Distribution of the music video may be a challenge. We will be depending on social media and our 140 chapters to distribute the video around the world. We may start small and let the distribution grow gradually. Raising enough money to do the companion music CD may be a challenge. If need be we will do a fundraiser concert or something like that. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
