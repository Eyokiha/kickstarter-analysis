Dear Friends, Family and Everyone In Between,It's a long road to making a record and I can't believe how far I've come! My debut EP, Providence, has been recorded, mixed and mastered. Photo shoots have taken place, the cd design is underway and the release show has been booked! So many pieces of the puzzle have fallen into place, but there is one last piece missing and that is where YOUR support is crucial. With the funds raised through this campaign, I will be able to manufacture cds of this project. As an indie artist, it is important to have a physical product to in order to actively participate in the music marketplace. I've spent the last couple of years learning and growing as an artist and everything I've written (good and bad), and all the shows I've played have contributed to the creation of this body of work. I am so fortunate to have your support and to be able to share my music with you. Thank you for helping to make my dreams come true!Be Well,Tracee
