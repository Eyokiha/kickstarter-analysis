We're going to create a next generation crowd sourcing platform to rival today's competitors. We'll do the same things they do, but better!!1!To lead the charge, we have a dedicated team comprised of web developers, IT managers, marketing professionals and project managers with the background and expertise to successfully launch this project. Risks and challenges Obviously there are other crowd funding platforms out there, including this one. The competition is great, but we feel we can build off of what some of these competitors do, but do it better. We liken ourselves to the underdog in this environment, but like many underdogs with great ideas, we will be able to overcome them with the pure "customer first" mentality. Based in the River North tech startup community, we will receive the support and infrastructure needed to get this project off the ground and successfully running. Lastly, we feel the fees are too high for the average project. Whereas some competitors will charge a 5% fee, which will drastically eat into the project budgets, we will only charge a 2% fee.
