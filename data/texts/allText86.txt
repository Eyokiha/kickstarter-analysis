Numbers of New York started as the result of a broken ankle. Told to move the joint as much as possible I began walking the neighborhoods of the city - slowly. I began to see the how the numbers on our buildings were unique; each had it's own style, color and placement and they ranged from the new and shiny to damaged and fading. I began to see them as a metaphor for the diversity of this multicultural place where the new is constantly replacing the old.Initially this project was an Instagram account where numbers were posted randomly but at the beginning of the year I began to post them sequentially, chosing from over 2,000 images. A website followed and now I am working with Digikea to produce a calendar. We are currently in the design phase and will go into production just before Thanksgiving. Each participant will receive a numbered and signed 12x12 calendar. Risks and challenges This is a low risk project. All of the images have been taken and the design process is near completion. Having the funding in place in early November leaves more than enough time for production and mailings so we don't anticipate any issues. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
