Hello, my name is Karl, I make music under the Spitfya name. Recently my computer decided to crap itself. It's sudden death means that I can no longer produce music. If you didn't already know, Music is a true passion for me, and with the way things have gone, I have no chance in producing music at all. I made this kickstarter for those that are willing to help me. I'm not asking you to pay for my computer for me, I'm asking for a lending hand to fund a replacement, an opportunity for you to support me if that's what you want to do. I'm taking on extra hours at work to help get more money quickly, but there's only so many hours they'll let me have, and I've got a long way to go. If you can help in supporting me, that would be beyond amazing. I've got a few perks available, take a look and see if you like them, by supporting me, you're allowing me to achieve something that is a huge part of my life. Risks and challenges I will be building my own computer. This allows me to get the most performance for the cheapest price, which allows every single penny to be able to go into streamlining music production. And, because I'm going to be completing the build with someone who's practically an expert, I'm fully confident that nothing will go wrong (Touch Wood). But seriously, there are not really any risks. Rest assured that if you do support me, none of the money will be wasted on things going wrong. Even parts that are faulty and DOA (Dead on arrival) are covered by the distributor. If you have any concerns, please, let me know... Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
