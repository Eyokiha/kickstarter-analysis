"Let's build a supercomputer" or (LBAS) is a project started by Marq Britt, a information technology student attending Eastern Florida State College, as well as an assembled team of computer science students. LBAS is a project focused on building a supercomputer, that the public can utilize. The project will utilize the Rasberry Pi cpu. The goal is to bring as many Rasberry Pi cpu's together, while working simultaneously, that can process large amounts of data, quickly, efficiently, and cheaper than the average desktop build most people have. If LBAS succeeds it will eventually be accessible to the public for use. A free supercomputer that anyone can use for any reason. This project will be open source and will constantly be updated with feedback to users. More information to come. Risks and challenges As with anything technological there is a risk that the project may not succeed because of hardware, software, etc, failure. We at "Let's build a Supercomputer" believe we can overcome these hurdles with the skills we possess. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
