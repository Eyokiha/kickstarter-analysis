********************************************PROJECT UPDATE DEC 12, 2015: Check out the the results for the great wall charger challenge! How does the HyperCharge HUB stack up against theAnker 2.4Amp chargers? Can the chargers adequately quench the Apple iPad AIR2's thirst for 2.4Amps of power? Check out the vid below.

Well below the 2.4Amps required for the iPad AIR2. This means up to 15% longer waiting for your device to charge. Which can take up to over 30mins more to charge an iPad AIR2 vs a true 2.4Amp charger. What's your time worth to you?HyperCharge HUB perfoms flawlessly as expected and delivers close to the 2.4Amp required by the iPad AIR2 as the device is over 50% charged. As new devices thirst for more power increases, they will require even greater power than what the iPad AIR2's 2.4Amp requires today. The need for more power just increases with every generation. This is the reason we rated the HyperCharge HUB to 3.5Amp. Above and beyond what's needed today. We want the HUB to be your complete future proofed charging solution that delivers for your device's today and for tomorrow! ********************************************PROJECT UPDATE NOV 21, 2015:Check out the the results for the great wall charger challenge!

Don't settle for anything else! Don't settle for anything else. HyperCharge your devices today with the HyperCharge HUB!Results:Both the Belkin 2.4Amp and iClever 2.4Amp chargers deliver only 2.09Amps.Well below the 2.4Amps required for the iPad AIR2. This means up to 15% longer waiting for your device to charge. Which can take up to over 30mins more to charge an iPad AIR2 vs a true 2.4Amp charger. What's your time worth to you?ChargeTech 2.4Amp charger delivers a true 2.4Amps. But there's a catch! A big one actually. When we plug another device, an Apple iPhone 5, the power output from the ChargeTech drops from 2.4Amp to 1.46Amp. A 40% drop in power! Which will take at least take another additional 90 minutes to charge the iPad to full capacity. The ChargeTech performs poorer than the original iPad Charger that comes from Apple. Worst of all when we take the iPhone back out the ChargeTech fails to go back to charging at 2.4Amp. This was shocking to us to say the least! What's your time worth to you?HyperCharge HUB perfoms flawlessly as expected and delivers the 2.4Amp required by the iPad AIR2. Best of all, when we charge two devices, the iPad AIR2 and Apple iPhone 5, the power delivery to the iPad AIR2 stays a rock solid at 2.4Amp. Our favorite part is when we plug two devices, iPad AIR2 and iPhone 5, are plugged into the same HyperCharge port of the HUB. The power output jumps from 2.4A to 3.5Amp to support the needed power from the iPhone. As new devices thirst for more power increases, they will require even greater power than what the iPad AIR2's 2.4Amp requires today. The need for more power just increases with every generation. This is the reason we rated the HyperCharge HUB to 3.5Amp. Above and beyond what's needed today.

Risks and challenges We looked at the aftermarket wall chargers that were available today and compared them to the industry benchmark from Apple and Samsung. As adequate as these solutions are a few years ago, we felt we could take the normal wall charging solution to the next level using our proprietary HyperCharging technology from our world renowned LithiumCard and LithiumCard PRO. After intensive research on available options, we felt today's wall chargers are barely adequate to sufficiently power the most latest mobile devices. They are not future proofed for today and tomorrow's faster smartphones with even larger and brighter screens. For example, less than 5 years ago, people believed USB wall chargers provided more than enough power for iPhone Gen 1 to 3, or about 1Amp. Less than 3 years ago, USB powered wall charger power increased to 2Amps to meet the needs of tablets, such as iPad Gen 1 to 3. Less than 2 years ago, USB powered wall charger power further increased to 2.4Amps to meet the needs to tablets and larger smartphones. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that power needs for smartphones and tablets will just keep increasing. The LinearFlux solution for this ever increasing need for more power was to develop the HyperCharg Hub. It's been future proofed to deliver up to an industry leading 3.5Amps and provide two HyperPorts for Apple iOS and Android devices. The HyperCharge Hub has met all compatability testing requirements and certifications. We need your kind pledge in order to go into the manufacturing stage, complete packaging assets, and meet minimum order quantities. Thank you for your support!
