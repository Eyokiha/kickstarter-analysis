I've lived a great deal of my life with my grandmother's cooking and I'd love to share her delicious meal with the world in a unique atmosphere. I moved to Austin in 2004 to attend the University of Texas and I couldn't find a single successful southern food restaurant. I've been craving good southern food and have had to travel to my mom's family in Houston to get what I'd like. I'd like to create a thriving beauty that brings the love and taste of the south for visitors that visit this great state so that they can take something home that they'll crave. I've created a business plan, a rotating menu, but I don't want to seek out a venue until I'm in a better financial situation to make my dreams come true. Risks and challenges My Grandmother has passed but her recipes live on through my cousins. I don't have a huge financial backing because my parents are deceased. I hope begin production and location search immediately. I'd like to be up and running by January-February 2016. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
