Hey Folks - We are almost over the hump to releasing our first album. We have been playing together for almost 2 years and have poured a lot of time and money into getting to this point. But, we need your help. To get us wrapped up with a small amount in the studio, finish up mixing, mastering, and get ready for production we need help from you. If you can help us out with any amount that is awesome. A minimum of $20 gets you a pre-sell of the album before its release date in late summer. For those that have a love for good local music that is independently produced, we appreciate your help in getting us over the finish line here. L&TL Risks and challenges Up until this point we have been pretty organized and on track with our album. Not much left to do and the a quick fundraising will get us to the finish line quickly.
