For the past four seasons iFc has presented free, innovative performances for the Ithaca community. The finest local musicians gather twice a year to donate their time towards a common goal; providing exceptional live music for local families, professionals and friends. Enjoy a past performance clip of cellist Zachary Sweet performing Piazzolla's "Le Grand Tango" with pianist Kathy Hansen, and three student dancers from Cornell University directed by choreographer Bryon Suber. May 19th's performance features Brahms' Sextet in G major with violinists Angeal Early and Alexa Schmitz, violist Mike Capone and cellists Erin Snedecor and Zachary Sweet. The performance will take place at the First Unitarian Church of Ithaca @ 6pm. Your donation ensures that the highest quality in talent and programming is available to our community. Be the first supporters of iFc and watch with enjoyment as this group takes you on a tour of masterful works in a fun, informative and casual environment. Follow us on Twitter @IthFreeConcerts Risks and challenges Ithaca has a unique density of highly trained musicians that survive on collaborations, performances, teaching and grants. Offering honorariums to our musicians provides incentive to the best musicians around the greater Ithaca area to choose our community for their talents. Additionally, your contribution will help in purchasing or renting scores, reserving rehearsal space, and putting together posters and other publicity. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
