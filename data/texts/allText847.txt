Localize: 日本の皆様へ: Japanese (日本語) Kickstarter项目: Chinese (中文) Update 2015.10.20: _________________________________________________________________Let's dive into the game world!Place UnlimitedHand on the arm, and synchronize your hand with the game world. UnlimitedHand senses the finger motion and gives the haptic feedback. Problem we are going to solveToday's virtual reality is limited to sight. Right now users can’t touch the objets. Users want to touch, feel and grab, throw, hit, push and be pushed by our surroundings. We need a new game controller to touch and feel. TechnologiesUnlimitedHand consists of the muscle sensor, 3D motion sensor, multi-channel electronic muscle stimulator (EMS) and vibration motor. With motion sensor and muscle sensors, users can input their hand and finger motion. Moreover, the device can output finger motion with EMS as a feedback from the video game. By integrating this technology into our game controller, affects such as bodily encounters and occasions of being inflicted with damage within games can be felt in person. PrototypeAfter years of R&D, we finished working prototype this summer. We are going to sophisticate the prototype toward final product. UnlimitedHand Prototype by H2L on Sketchfab It's becoming the talk all over the world. "Delivered sensations to each of my fingers in a way that made it feel like I was actually touching something that wasn’t there." - TechCrunch, US"Les premiers pavés vers une véritable logique de retour physique associé à la réalité virtuelle" - Clubic, France"腕の動きに合わせてプレイできるUnlimitedHandはまさに理想的なコントローラー" - Gigazine, JapanSee more talks on media listRewards PlatformsSince there are vast applications for finger-controlling technology, we will provide the devices for game developers with Unity plugin. Taking open platform strategy, we will make the product as open as possible. Schedule Future ApplicationsOther possibilities are: feeling haptic sensation of musical instruments with music playing games, or “touching” virtual objects in virtual reality games.

We are founded in 2012, with the electronic stimulation technology that can control user's finger motion. The invention, called PossessedHand, is selected one of the "Best 50 inventions" in TIME Magazine.WebsitesTwitter, FacebookH2L websiteUnlimitedHand website Risks and challenges SHIPPING We will start shipping UnlimitedHand to our backers in March 2016. We are working with partner that is highly experienced with shipping the similar electronic device. We think the most of our Kickstarter backers, so all Kickstarter orders will be fulfilled before any retail orders. MANUFACTURING Our team has highly skilled hardware and software engineers to tackle with any engineering problems. However, there are always risks in sourcing and manufacturing. We have already found and cooperated in prototyping with trustworthy manufacturer that has ISO 9001 and ISO 13485. We promise to be transparent and communicate any potential delays and important milestones. SAFETY ISSUE UnlimitedHand uses electronic stimulation. This feature has been studied since 2011 at a laboratory of the University of Tokyo. The safety of the device is guaranteed by the study with over 200 participants and no injured person. The stimulator is designed based on Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) of home use electronic stimulator. We promise to make our best to design carefully and test thoroughly for safety product.
