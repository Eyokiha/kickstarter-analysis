"My Castle" follows a solitary young man, (Charlie Williams), whose bizarre relationship with what seem like inanimate objects begins to take a dark turn. After reluctantly accepting an outsider into his home, Charlie struggles to maintain command of the world he has created. However, just because he has birthed it, does not make it his to control. This is not your parent's horror film."My Castle" is a dark, gritty, mind-bending horror story that draws heavily on the influences of foreign masters like Takashi Miike, Gaspar Noe, and early Michele Saovi. An angry exploration of relationships, sex, and brutality that will likely push even some seasoned horror fans beyond their thresholds.Before I start selling my body on the streets to complete funding, I wanted to bring this ambitious project to Kickstarter. I believe that the horror community is ready for something unique and viciously beautiful. If my optimism is well-placed, then we will get to see this film within a year.Every penny we raise will go toward making this the intelligently traumatic movie-going experience you have been craving. We have a rich talent pool of world-class crew and special effects artists here in the Atlanta area, having worked on films like "Halloween 2", the upcoming grindhouse homage "Dear God No!", and countless other projects.I encourage you to check out my (extremely low budget) work at theDavidAnthony.com and my articles at CouchCutter.com to get more acquainted with me.
