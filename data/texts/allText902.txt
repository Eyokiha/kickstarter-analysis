Seeking to partner with an app developer about creating a mobile product that can assist law enforcement / criminal justice professionals. The app will interactively keep track and notify the user of all required certifications, training and development for the individual professional. Criminal justice certifications, training and development is constant process. The CJ development app can assist with this as well as offer other types of functionality. Risks and challenges Setbacks are a part of any project or endeavor, and also in life. I really believe that any obstacle can be overcome in life with the right mindset, believing in yourself when others don't and surrounding yourself with the right people. Having a strong drive and belief in a product that can assist my fellow criminal justice professionals is what keeps me going forward with this project. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
