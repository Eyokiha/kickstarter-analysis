GAR presents The BLUE Album: Studio RecordingOne of our most incredible concerts ever. Now, you can have a recording of that special night. We're going into the studio to record our versions of all the songs on the Joni Mitchell 1971 classic, BLUE. Maggie Hollinbeck interprets these songs like no one else; both honoring and altering these incredible masterpieces, she sounds just like Joni and also doesn't at all. Help us. We need to pay for the studio time.
