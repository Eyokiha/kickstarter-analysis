The goal of this kickstarter is to raise funds to build a prototype for a project that I am very passionate about. The team currently consists of myself, Joe Wilmouth, as well as a smart team of individuals out in Pittsburgh. The prototype is going to be of a low cost, high efficiency carbon dioxide scrubbing machine that will make an impact on one of the biggest generational plights. Currently there is roughly 401 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, that might not sound like a lot but its a little bit over 8 billion metric tons of CO2 that exists in the atmosphere. If you think about it, an average human breathes in 11,000 liters of air per day. While we take precaution in what we eat, what we drink, what we do, what we don't do is take care of the most important factor and that is our air.This prototype will be the first step in solving this puzzle that large corporations have not figured out, how to stymie or reverse the growth in emission of CO2. Committed people make changes, not bureaucracy or economics. Risks and challenges The biggest risk in this project is developing a prototype that is sound and achieves what it is supposed to do. I have some engineering background, however with this type of application it may be tricky to maximize the scrubbing capacity. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
