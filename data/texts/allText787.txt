I would like not only to save time grocery shopping but this idea will create jobs all across america. The app i would like to create will save time grocery shopping. I would like to have all the major grocery stores participating in using this app as well. The app will have different stores such as target, Walmart, and Publix for an example, then pick the location where you would like to pick up your groceries. When completed the order will be sent to the store you chose and they will work on fulfilling your order and let you know when it will be ready to be picked up. The app will be very user friendly and easy to use. It will have virtual aisles just like a grocery store so picking what you want will be easy. You will also be able to set up an acct so the app will know your favorite store and location without you having to always choose. The app will also let you know when the order is received by the store, when it is being fulfilled and when it is ready for pick up. Risks and challenges The biggest risk it getting the major stores to adopt this idea and create jobs. I am working with Nick Bugara the Senior project consultant for Zapporoo-Software Application and Development Firm. I do believe that with his help we can accomplish this.
