We are a mother and daughter team from Western Australia. We have noticed that you can't get healthy food conveniently while out and about. Its so easy to go to McDonald's but we all know that it isn't good for you. We also understand the annoyance of having food allergies, having Coeliac's in the family. Harvest Hut will cater to families, those with allergies, food restrictions, and people wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. Our plan is to open stores around Australia and hopefully worldwide. Starting with one in Perth, Western Australia. We expect to serve over 3,000 customers per month. The caf√© will predominately be take away however there will be seats for customers who wish to eat their take-away food at the premises.We hope to have foods like fresh salad bowls, sushi, wraps, baked sweet potato's, smoothie bowls, raw curries, bliss balls, coffees and smoothies with lactose free milk options, juices, raw cakes, "nice" creams and sorbets. We will have a changing and evolving menu.At Harvest Hut we aim to be as eco friendly as possible, with environmentally friendly packaging for all our foods and drinks. Risks and challenges I am new to the food industry but I have been a business owner previously. With two Coeliac daughters I understand the frustration at not being able to find food for them to eat while we are out. The more I speak to people the more I am being told of other people's allergies and intolerance's and food preferences and their difficulty in finding food whilst out. One of our challenges will be knowing how to go about opening the store. As we are new to the food industry, we will be seeking knowledge from chefs, cafe/ restaurant managers and owners to make Harvest Hut the best it can be. We hope to hire a chef that has a strong knowledge in food intolerances. We have been in contact with the local council who are eager to help us with our endeavour.
