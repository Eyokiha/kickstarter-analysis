You are an uprising artist? You want to share music with a huge audience? Or you just love music from many genres? It is our goal to help new bands and artists to get into business, and show you a whole new level of widely unknown Artists. Flukly makes this just as simple as that. Artists share their songs with the community. Fundamental is SoundCloud, there many artists upload their songs, especially in the startup phase. How do people know there is this awesome new song? This is exactly what Flukly is supposed to do - telling them. First, we differentiate between Artists and Listeners. The artist registers through SoundCloud and synchronizes all songs with Flukly. The next step is to choose the right genre, and share your songs. The Listener simply chooses the preferred genres, and by that only gets fitting matches. The artists can also listen to other people’s music. To keep the sharing process as easy as possible, you do not have to sign up. The artist uses his SoundCloud account, and Listeners choose multiple genres. With every shared track 25 random Listeners will be selected to hear the song. We also evenly spread the music between the Listeners. If you want to reach more users, you can buy packages, which will send your songs to 100, 200, 500, and more users. If a user likes a song, there is the possibility to reshare and reach another 25 people. Therefore the music spreads through chain reaction. The Listener is also granted access to the SoundCloud sites of the artists to follow them and hear more music. Please support us with any amount of money and automatically get packages and more. With your help we can create a new community where music has no borders! example for screen design example for share screen (Artist) example playlist example Listener screen example Playlist Projekt Team: Christian Millwitsch / founder Dalibor Dramac / co founder Jeremy Sternad / developer Mario König / developer Risks and challenges Dear Community! We want you to know everything about the project, therefore, we have to be honest about problems, that may occur during the process. First of all, Flukly is our only project, so we can fully concentrate on this idea. The main problem we can possibly have is, that after the financing, our community will not be as big as we hoped for. So our variety and range for our artists would be limited. To solve this we would invest more money in marketing to get the community to grow. Technical problems will not be big obstacles, small bugs will be fixed as soon as they emerge. Smaller issues can always occur, but you can be sure, that you will be in the safe hands of our team, who will be fully encouraged to provide fast solutions. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
