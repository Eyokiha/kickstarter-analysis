Peru!!My project was sparked by my wanderlust and desire to travel and see the world for myself. Rather than just seeing the world I wanted to absorb different cultures and make a difference to other people's lives by leaving my footsteps in a way that inspires other young people to do the same.I will be travelling to Peru for a month during July 2015 whereby I will be volunteering in a Children's home, helping the children to learn and interact with each other and giving them a basic learning of the English language.It is clear that these children are underprivileged in various ways. Some have suffered abuse or economical issues in which they need to live in a home. I will be helping the staff to provide meals, supervision and days out with the children as it is apparent that the staff cannot do this on their own. My personal aim is to allow the children to use my camera and take photos on the days out with my photo-graphical experience. I will teach them how to appropriately use a lens and focus on beautiful, high quality photos. I will carry on taking photos during the rest of my travels to make a beautiful photo album of South America. Risks and challenges The risks of the project will probably be travelling on my own! However I am learning Spanish to assist my travelling of South America. Furthermore, it will be costly to produce all of the photos for the photo album but with help and my job I can obtain the funds and do it! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
