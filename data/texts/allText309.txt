The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (MADE) needs a space in the San Francisco Bay Area. All funds raised here will be used exclusively for the rent and utilities associated with a ~1000 sq ft space near BART for 6 months to a year, depending on the rent we find. Additional funds will keep the space open longer. A space will enable us to showcase videogame artifacts and educate the public about the artistry, craftsmanship and inspiration that go into the creation of videogames and digital works of art. This space will also act as meeting place and event venue for the local community. There are several ongoing game related community events in the Bay Area that need a reliable and free space to continue their missions of bringing people together. That means LAN parties, demo scene events, and artist talks. We've already got a storage locker full of artifacts and a community of dedicated individuals working to make The MADE a reality. We've also been deemed a not for profit by the IRS. Now we just need a space. 100% of funds raised here will be spent on rent and monthly incidentals (power, internet, etc.). We pledge that your funds will only be spent on the space itself, not on anything frivolous like big tv's and projectors (got em already). Just the space. The full mission statement can be found here: http://www.themade.org/content/what-are-we Want to help in another way? We're looking for volunteers as well.
