The Tom Bowl, the only major college bowl game not sanctioned by the NCAA, annually pits the top teams in the nation to determine the true national champion. This will be the 26th year of the Tom Bowl. The Tom Bowl has appeared in the Detroit Free Press, Columbus Dispatch, Baltimore Sun, The Sporting News, SI.com and on CNN Headline News and has its own wikipedia entry. More details about the Tom Bowl can be found at www.tombowl.com. The web page is becoming expensive to maintain and the Tom Bowl operates at a negative budget. Assistance in funding this website will allow the Tom Bowl website to continue. Thanks Risks and challenges People will not know who the true #1 team in the nation really is.
