I have a dream to create a photo journal of the Castles of Scotland, something I've had in my head for years.I intend to travel to all the Castles listed in Scotland and create a photo journal with enough images to create and publish a coffee table book.This Kickstarter project is to cover all expenses to get me to Scotland, travel and capture all the images I need to create the book and publish it. Risks and challenges The biggest risk to this project is not having enough funding to complete a full transverse of Scotland and it's outer islands to capture all the listed castles of Scotland.
