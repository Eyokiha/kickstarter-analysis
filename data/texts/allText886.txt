I'm raising money to cover cost of design and development for YOUR BOWLING CADDY Mobile App. This Mobile App. is design to take on the same responsibilities a golf caddie typically would for a professional golfer. However this App. will be your caddy on the lanes, taking the guess work out of bowling. Thus allowing the amateur bowler to throw better shots, increasing their score(s) while having more fun. Risks and challenges The challenges faced with completing this project are coding challenges. As with any Application there is a large of amount of coding required which takes a significant amount of time to complete. I've enlisted the help of a top of the line design and a development company. Who will be able to handle any design and or coding issue in a timely manner should they arise.
