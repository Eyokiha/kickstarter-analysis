Coming from England, I was DJ'ing from the early age of 13, playing old skool hardcore vinyls on an online radio station, eventually, I moved onto Ableton Live 9 & studied Music Technology at college. Eventually, at the age of 23, I moved to Berlin to pursue my dream of being a Techno DJ & Producer. After over 1 year, I have made enough contacts, both with big labels and club promotors to begin the career, BUT and it's a big but, Berlin living is so expensive at this moment in time! I spent all my previous savings to buy a Macbook Pro, now I just need a soundcard and good speakers! I am currently using creative pc speakers (used for gaming) so you can imagine the quality!With a need to proceed professionally, I first need professional equipment!Every cent made from this Kickstarter will be happily spent at Thormann.de, then the career will commence in no time!Thank you for reading this far, here are some social media links...soundcloud.com/elitecreationsfacebook.com/creatingelite Risks and challenges The only real challenge for me is to keep up my self confidence when playing in Berlin's big techno clubs. Making music is not an issue with professional equipment. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
