Since I was about ten years old, I have been excited by cameras and different ways to photograph every day life. I also have a large interest in soccer (or fútbol, as it is called in Spain). So when I was recently given the opportunity to travel to Spain by my university, I decided this would be a great chance to mix the two together.During my trip to Spain we will be travelling to both Barcelona and Madrid. During this time, I would like to photograph the many people of the two cities and the rivalry between two of the largest fútbol capitals in the world as well as gather history on the rivalry to create an album, or short book displaying this rivalry.While we are travelling to these two cities, my teacher has made no plans to tour the Bernabéu or Camp Nou and I will need to provide myself with funds to travel to these two sites as well as purchase the tickets to tour the stadiums.Any amount that can be donated towards this project would be greatly appreciated. Risks and challenges I am currently a very broke college student and do not have the time to get a job in order to raise money for this trip. So any money donated is amazing and will be a great help.
