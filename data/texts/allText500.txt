Many filmmakers start off with a vision that they want to get out there to the public. My team and I are no different. We created a story that we feel needs to be told during this turbulent time we live in. People always say that they don’t understand how someone can be push down the wrong path, or how easy the cycle can be broken, and how one can change their ways. “Choices” is examination of a person’s life and how the wrong choices have taken him towards the wrong path. What we need funding for is equipment such as better audio (Microphones), additional lenses for a true cinematic experience, and getting this film to as many viewers as possible. With your help this dream can become a reality. Risks and challenges If the project is successfully funded the only risk is on us (by us I mean myself, my crew, and everyone who donates) not spreading the word about this film. With the proper equipment and support from people like yourself this can get done. We have few films lined up after this project but our main objective is “Choices”. As a veteran of the United States Air Force, one of our core values I was taught was “Excellence in all we do” and to me I know that when I have someone counting on me to get the job done, I know I can’t give them a subpar job. I must and I will give them a superior product that represents myself and the people I work with. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
