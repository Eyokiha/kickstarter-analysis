Tours of the counties many waterfalls led by a native guide. What sets our business apart from similar tour services is the offering of several tour packages which take into account participants fitness level, but also intent for the tour. (Photography, eco-tourism, seeing the most famous waterfalls in the area, or conversely seeing lesser known “hidden gem” falls) As an added benefit and safety measure, tour guide is CPR, and First aid certified by the American Heart Association. Permits from Pisgah National Forest and Dupont State Forest will also be obtained for commercial use, which require one million dollar business liability insurance, adding another layer of protection to the tour participants. With a tour guide who is well versed in not only local settler lore but also Native American traditions and lore concerning the area and its waterfalls in particular .We feel that this will add a level of cultural experience for tourist, and even educational to locals who take our tours. All these factors we believe will set Eastatoe Trails apart from the completion to an extent that will lead to business success.
