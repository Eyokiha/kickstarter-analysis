Martin is my son and he wants to go with my husband and I on a trip to Washington D.C.Martin loves to take pictures and do short movies.*See above movie* He loves to watch them too. He remembers everything about them, as you will see in the mini movie above. It will be interesting to see what his thoughts are on Washington D.C.If I get this funded we can get him to Washington via our car. We will share our journey via Martin's photo's and movies so you can get a full vision of what is important to an autistic man in Washington D.C.The money takes care of hotels, food, venue prices, fuel. The occasional accident at the Smithsonian gift shop. Possible burning of toast, waffles, pancakes, etc. at any number of Holiday Inn Expresses. Replacing of a toilet in the above HIE because of small objects thrown into them.Having a child with special needs is expensive, however, it is rewarding. Their insights on life and people and their surroundings can be silly, hilarious, factual, heartwarming, and enlightening.So anything is good. But 1500.00 will get us there. Thanks for your interest. Risks and challenges Risk is that Martin will have a meltdown or that something will happen on the road trip like a car breakdown or that we will have to get him his medicine because he's thrown it away (which is a real possibility.) The challenges are to be able to download all Marty's pictures and movies every night and to be able to get him through venues and places like Arlington Cemetery without a major scene or major self-talking explosions. Martin is loud, can we get him through the Smithsonian without having to apologize? Can we get him in and out of hotels without incurring some dramatic cost? Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
