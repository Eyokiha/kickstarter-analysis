SO BLESSED, to have reached the "ground-breaking" goal for this project, and so QUICKLY. Thank you all SO much, BUT to restate again, additional support increases the capabilities of the recording process and reduces the harsh pay cut that John is taking for the project, so please continue to be generous, and pass the WORD around!!Robb Esperat could be one of many things: your friend, your teacher, your family, your champion, your pastor, your co-laborer, your accomplice, your kindred spirit, or your inspiration. To many he is some or all of these. No matter your relationship to him, all know that his music, his words, his art, are precious and are worthy of preserving. The music is a charming lullaby, it warms your heart or sets it ablaze, it dazzles with its skill and craft, it evokes with its honesty, and it calls for response. To awake, to experience, to taste and see, that it is a gift, to be cherished, yet one that should also be shared. The FACTS: Recording is intimidating, time consuming, and expensive. Robb Esperat, despite years of musical creation and expression, has never released the full length album that his music and his supporters deserve. John Anderson of WHALEHEAD RECORDS http://whalehead.tumblr.com/ along with local art collective Love Greatly http://lovegreatly.blogspot.com/ have decided to take on the project. $700 pays for a simple 10 song album to be recorded and mixed at an extremely reduced cost (thanks to John). Any additional Support will increase the capabilities of the recording process and reduce the harsh pay cut that John is taking for the project, so please give generously. Any questions can be directed to me, Andrew Lane, via email at greatlylove@gmail.com. Special thanks and credit go to Daniel Jeter and Nathanael Allison for shooting and producing the excellent kick starter video, couldn't have done it without them, now its time to do your part!!
