What's your gol? Ours is to help soccer fans, coaches, players, and parents all over the world get fit so they can enjoy playing the Beautiful Game. We released our app, Soccer Fitness Gols, on Google Play in July, and now have over 1,000 installs across 6 continents. We now want to bring our app to iPhone users. Your funding will help us develop and market the first release of the app on iOS later this Fall. Our budget for this project is:- $7,000 to translate core code from Java to Objective C- $3,000 to develop user interface elements for the iPhone- $2,500 to conduct user testing- $2,500 to promote and marketIn the meantime, please check out our blog for information and conversation on the latest in soccer fitness. We truly appreciate your support! Risks and challenges The biggest challenge we face is getting exposure beyond all the other fitness apps available in the market. Expanding to iOS will allow us to start marketing our app directly with the soccer communities we support today. We believe Soccer Fitness Gols is the best way for soccer fans, coaches, and players to start getting in shape to play the Beautiful Game today. The next biggest challenge we face is funding the iOS release. We launched a campaign on Kickstarter recently, and were unsuccessful. This time, we have reduced the scope of the iOS release to just match the functionality of the current Android version of the app, and therefore reduced our funding target.
