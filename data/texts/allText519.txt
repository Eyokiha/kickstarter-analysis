A Special Message From Creator Keli Wolfe Puberty Bites is an anthology of horror short films. All the films address the difficulties of being a teen in a world of popularity, prom and prehensile tailed monsters trying to destroy your life.My minimum goal is $4,000 to "kickstart" the series with the first film: The Dollhouse. MINIMUM GOAL: A "HAUNTING" SHORT FILMUpon moving to a new town, Ellie is overwhelmed by her new situation. Her family thinks its nerves but Ellie knows something isn't right. Plus, she is 90 percent sure the dollhouse in her bedroom just ate her brother. The Dollhouse stars Reese Kirkham and Augustine Frizzell. DOUBLE FEATURE STRETCH GOAL: $6,000A car full of drunk teens headed to a party in the woods seems like harmless fun but somehow everything goes wrong when they hit what they think is a hiker. Hilarity ensues as a half-goat, half-man picks the kids off one at a time. Spoiler Alert: Don't get attached to the kids. Goat Island stars Kasey Conner and Braylen Chritian. TRIPLE FEATURE STRETCH GOAL: $8,000Bitch is a love story... obviously. When a werewolf from the wrong side of the woods falls for a country good ol' boy who has a pension for hunting, the fireworks and fur flies. Can their love survive? Can they survive each others love? The cast is not finalized for this film. Risks and challenges The big risk for this project is everyone quitting. I don't see that happening but if it does, we will find new people. People are everywhere. I see them all the time. Also Joss Whedon may not appreciate my Buffy references in the pitch video but he is more than welcome to call me and talk it out. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
