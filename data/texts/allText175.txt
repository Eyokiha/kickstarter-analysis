Hello, We are an electronic-pop duo who is almost finished with our full length debut album (yay!) We decided it would be awesome to have a bangin' video to go with our songs...if time and money affords, we really want to do TWO :)) Simply put: we are looking for funding to produce two great looking videos. We have a director who has assembled a team, and we just need a little dough to help us realize our dream. We are looking to raise $1,000 to pay and feed the crew, hire a stylist + makeup artist. Once the album is mastered in a few weeks, we would like to offer anyone who makes a $10 or more donation a digital download to show our thanks. Here is a little taste of the album (great for fans of Massive Attack, Air, Zero7, and Portishead).http://www.reverbnation.com/loversandpoets Thank you!! Shannon + Ben (Lovers and Poets)
