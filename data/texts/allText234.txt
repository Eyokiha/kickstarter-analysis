The Alley Family is Dan, DeAnna, Daniel (17), and Heather (14). https://www.facebook.com/TheAlleyFamilyMusic We are a family that has always listened to and loved to sing old-time gospel songs. We have been singing in our church since Heather was a small child. Due to recent events, we have been inspired to record a family gospel CD. We quickly found that this a costly venture, and were advised that offering prepayment may be good way to allow us to complete the project. This website, Kickstarter, is an ideal avenue for those interested, to make a donation of any amount, toward The Alley Family current CD project and future projects. Any amount is appreciated, and a donation of $15 includes a CD shipped to you. Other rewards are listed on the right. We began recording our first CD Saturday 1/18/14. It is currently a work in progress. What we are asking for is funding to help us get the CD duplicated, the covers made and copied, etc. If we make any extra, we will use it for future Cds (We already have plenty of songs in mind!) and to travel to some of the churches that have invited us to perform. Please visit our Facebook page to see more music. Any questions, just ask! We truly appreciate any help we can get for our project! Thank you and we feel truly blessed to have been given this opportunity to use our voices to sing His praise, and pray God blesses you and your family also. Risks and challenges The challenges involved with this project will be the time involved in practicing and getting future CD's together, in the studio, in a timely manner. We have a large repertoire of songs though, and many ideas for future CD's so we are confident we can do this! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
