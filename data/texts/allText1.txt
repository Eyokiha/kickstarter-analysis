I have worked as an occupational therapist in preschool and kindergarten classrooms for 17 years. Kindergarten standards have changed!!! Kids who enter kindergarten without being able to: print their name beginning with a capital followed by lower case, print numbers, cut out simple shapes and hold a pencil with a proper grasp fall behind. In the past these were the skills acquired in kindergarten. Now kids who enter without these skills lose confidence quickly and often begin to dislike school or act out with poor behaviors. I am creating a toolkit with the items I use daily with the children I work with in schools and in my private tutoring practice. What makes this kit most unique is the instructional DVD. It tells why each activity is chosen and how it works to develop muscles necessary in the hand and upper body for children to be successful in kindergarten. The parent becomes the expert!!! These activities are tried and true tested by hundreds of kids that I have personally worked with. Risks and challenges After 17 years in classrooms I have become very picky about the quality of the items I use. This being said, I have a specific brands I will not compromise on using in the kit. Because I will be ordering from many different companies, shipping or out of stock items could push back the date of completion. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
