After working with many families who have been plagued by this awful disease, I feel compelled to play my part and give back to those in every way possible. Not only can HIV debilitate the carrier extremely fast, it can place financial hardships on those who cannot afford the proper treatment. My organization consists of three parts: treatment, prevention, and aid.First, we look at alternatives to antiviral medications, the mechanics of these drugs, as well as the reservoirs that are responsible for rebounds in viral count. Finding the reservoirs that these viral particles lay dormant plays a huge roll in keeping viral counts low. Today's antiretroviral drugs can clear blood viral counts to nearly 0, though once the drug is discontinued, we see a rebound effect from the dormant viral particles. Most drugs used today are also extremely toxic, and often cause kidney failure. It is imperative to find alternatives to these medications.Second, we can start by educating those on the transmission of the virus, and the best way to prevent the spread of a virus. We also want to look into providing home test kits to provide quick and accurate results. Third, we need to aid those families who cannot afford proper treatment. This is an extremely important aspect of my proposal. Many families will never be able to afford the medications they need in order to take care of their families. Keeping viral count low takes stress off the immune system, which in turn slows the spread of the virus. Funds will be dispersed as listed:25% - HIV prevention education25% - Medication aid50% - Research in the mechanisms of antiretroviral drugs, as well as viral reservoirs If you know someone who has been affected, or want to give back to society, every donation helps. Risks and challenges The biggest challenge is to find funding! This is an area of research that requires a lot of generous donations. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
