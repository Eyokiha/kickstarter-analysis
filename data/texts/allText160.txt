I have been performing music since the age of 16, performing with bands across the country from New York to Las Vegas and places in between. I have been fortunate enough to be able to continue to write songs and share them around the world thanks to this technology we call the internet.I am currently working on my 6th release. It's been almost two years since my last release and am very excited for this up coming release.Thanks for taking the time to read this and with your help, looking forward to the release of "Short Stories" in early November 2014. Risks and challenges Most of the project is completed, songs are written. Should any situation come up, we will address it in a timely manner. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
