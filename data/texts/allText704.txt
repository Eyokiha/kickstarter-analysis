Sample Packaged product One side open Assembly Easy to install Very simple to install and use! Risks and challenges Hi everyone, first I want to thank you all for taking a look at our campaign. We all have worked long hours to achieve this stage. Now we need funding for producing more samples for public opinion and their thoughts on functionality, ease of use and protection. We are now prepared and ready to go! We have a single cavity injection mold ready to produce our Plug Protectors at a reasonable cost. So here you go, I hope you like it and I truly hope it saves many toddlers lives in all of our futures! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
