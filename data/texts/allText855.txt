New era in the manufacture of silver colloidsThis technology represents the first standardization and implementation of ultrasound in manufacturing colloidal silver. The Ultrasonic AdvantageUltrasound guarantees silver ions are both nano and round. A rounder particle lends more surface area to bind; much like a new automobile tire has more complete surface area to connect to the road, ultrasonic silver is also able to make a more complete connection both for internal and external use. This invention solves the problems of particle clumping, negates the need for stirring, removes the inconvenience to clean wires while in progress, and standardizes the ideal particle ppm shape and size. cap underside top view cap with silver wires installed top view jar with 24V ac adapter connected top angle view direct horizontal view fitting appliance Bringing home the benefits of silverInvention allows anybody to independently own and make their own multi-use nano silver hydrosol and thereby substitute and consolidate a number of common household supplies for one renewable. Current commercial uses for nano silver include: Nutritional supplement Immune system support Topical skin application Fabric softener Laundry detergent Body washes Shampoos Conditioners Hand sanitizers Anti-static hair spray Mouth wash, rinse Tooth brush Toothpaste Clothes, socks towels Mineral supplement All purpose disinfectant Counter tops , cutting boards Floors Bathroom toilet seats Urinals Public phones, desks, computer tables Glass, porcelain, glazed ceramic Baby bottles, chew toys, pacifiers Wound dressing and care Food storage Food containers Air filtration and purification Water purification and filtration Pool cleaning Algae growth prevention Antimicrobial gels and sprays Medical facilities Washing machines Refrigerator deodorizer Deodorants Moisture management Vacuum cleaner, filters Cosmetics Dentures Cleaning wipes Humidifiers Outdoor, indoor plants Fungicide Insecticide Larvicide Domestic animals Tapeworms Morgellons Mange Easier than making a pot of coffee insert silver wires into cap add 1 1/4 oz (or 50 mL) of cool tap water to resevoir place jar filled with Distilled Water into reservoir plug 24V ac adapter into reservoir add cap onto device after 30 minutes, measuring 6 ppm with TDS Stretch Goal $2500!!Help to support our mission of dispersing this technology on a global scale to those you feel may benefit from this device! It is our wish to change the world one precious individual at a time; to improve the human experience and enable us all to build a more perfect world. Back a reward and have a device sent to someone you love, a friend or family member. EvolutionThis machine has made a number of evolutionary changes to advance beyond the overly complicated and uncertain convention, removed all unnecessary and redundant gadgetry, and limited complexity by keeping and improving on the generators purpose: to make the most bio effective hydrosol. Determinations3-6 ppm is imperative because it limits saturation, aggregation and allows for maximum bio effectiveness; When there are too many colloids, or large irregular particle sizes, saturation inevitably increases; meaning a net blockage occurs disallowing the free introduction of silver particles toward their destination.All-in-one, product specificationsProduct dimensions are, for the 3 oz generator, 7 1/2 inch x 2 1/4 inch. Total weight equals 1 1/2 lb. It further standardizes an ideal 3-6 ppm of nano spheres in 30 minutes with no cleaning or maintenance, yielding 3 + oz silver hydrosol. Also includes 2 silver wires, 14 gauge, 3 inches, plus 24V ac adapter, and 18V under the hood.IndependenceUltrasonic Nano Silver Generator allows for anyone to make their own high quality silver and potentially consolidate efforts, expense and products in exchange for a uniform, universal and renewable option as a nutritional health alternative and as a highly reliable disinfectant.Hand made in the USAFor the research enthusiast:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052079/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20724010 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667477/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20528456 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682937 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23636779 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930870 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22682937 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18547751 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23636779 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21749202 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24292075 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930870 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119875 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969598 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24490364 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21394018 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16832825 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583805 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23418027 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771750/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23072572 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23124018 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19344093 http://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=3653761_ijn-8-1809f4&req=4 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692561/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920662/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998856/ http://www.scs.illinois.edu/suslick/http://csc.hcmiu.edu.vn/BME2010/keynote.htm Risks and challenges Challenges include access to experimental metals, primarily for materials, including the housing, and all internal working components specifically tailored and calibrated to surpass expectations. Risks are inherent in all creative endeavors, however regarding this project, I imagine production could be challenged by manufacturing end due to product choice metal housing, if indeed this proves to be the correct path. However steps have been taken to ensure the greatest likely anticipated time, and are therefore reflected in investors promised due dates. For example, all existing components can be accessed and assembled even if inventor was travelling alone in car across the U.S. on vacation. Any difficulties will be promptly anticipated, voiced and overcome with the greatest attention to committment and diligence. All challenges and risks have contingency planning built in, and for those unseen, measures will be implemented to reduce complication. Any inventor enjoys the inherent problems posed by the creative puzzle, including the ones involving processes. Every cell of my body vibrates with the will and need of this joy, therefore all risks and challenges will no doubt be happily overcome. Schedule: September 7: Upon completion of successful project, and funds have clearedmaterials will be ordered which takes roughly 7 - 10 days to receive. September 17 - Manufacturing of devices begins (takes roughly 3 days to perfect 20 devices. September 21 - Shipment of devices begin. First come first serve. Backers will receive Ultrasonic Nano Silver Generator in the order pledges were made. September 23 - all shipments are scheduled to complete. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
