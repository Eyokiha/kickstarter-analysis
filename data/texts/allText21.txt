Imagine… Sad eyes, cramped cages, matted fur, noxious odors, and unsanitary conditions.This is how Shepard’s life began in an puppy mill.I saved him from this and have given him a new lease on life.He is now a happy, health, rambunctious little monster with the personality of an Irish wolf hound in the body of the world’s cutest miniature schnauzer. Shepard has been the best addition to my life in recent years and I want to share with Shep the journey of a lifetime by taking him on long road trip from the steamy bayou’s of Louisiana to the cool expanses of the Alaskan wilderness. I plan on taking two separate routes so that each day is new scenery, new adventures, and new photo ops. At the completion of the trip the reward will be a 2015 calendar. With your donation, hopefully the photo essay I create from this amazing journey will promote awareness of the horrors of puppy mills.The funding for this project will be put toward equipment for the journey, lodging and gas. Risks and challenges I foresee the only potential risk being equipment failure. I do not believe this will be an issue though as I am mechanical inclined and consider myself an all-around MacGyver. Mother Nature is also likely to cause problems, but this only adds to the adventure. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
