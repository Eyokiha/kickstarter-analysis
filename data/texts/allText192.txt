The Lost Pines' long awaited second album is almost here! We have all the songs written and arranged; some we've been playing for the last 3 years and others never yet performed live. For this very special project we have enlisted the help of Grammy Award winning producer Lloyd Maines (best known for his work with the Dixie Chicks.) We have dates reserved in January 2011 at The Zone Recording Studio in Dripping Springs, TX with engineer Pat Manske.http://www.thezonerecordingstudio.moonfruit.com/ We have been diligently saving up money over the last 3 years from our performances but great producers and studios don't come cheap! Here's a breakdown of estimated costs: Lloyd Maines, Producer- $600/day, 8 days = $4,800.00 Pat Manske, Engineer @ The Zone Recording Studio- $500/day = $4,000.00 Mastering- $1000 CD Duplication- $1500 T-shirts and mailing costs for backer rewards- $1000 Grand Total= $12,300.00 Subtract what we already have in the bank and we need $8,000 to complete this project!
