We are living in an extremely progressive world, where relationships and love are becoming more and more special. Tap into your emotions and show how much you care. Use footsteps in its online form to always remember the most important moments. Create paths & webs with family members, your boyfriend or girlfriend, best friends. It is a perfect way to intimately stay in touch with those that may be a long ways away, or the person that comes home to you everyday. Footsteps is for everybody.Post pictures, leave stories, share them with those in your network. Create circles and remember the past that made you smile today. Footsteps is unique in the fact that the ownership rights to the account can be framed however you like, as well as the ability to edit on the page. You can invite friends into your "life" and remove them when the time is right. With your generous contribution, I will be hiring a team of web and app developers to take my platform and make it live. I am extremely passionate about this project because it is meant for people that truly care for one another. Risks and challenges I consider myself to be entrepreneurial and innovative, but Footsteps will be my sole focus. I know that all projects have their own individual challenges, but there is no challenge too large. I do not see any problems with launching the website. I need the funds to be able to hire an individual to create my vision and make it secure. The next step would be marketing the website, which I hope Kickstarter can help with. I am very active on social media, as well as LinkedIn, and I am confident that funds will always be available. Ultimately, I hope this initial startup will assist in gauging interest.
