We’ve recently been presented with an exciting opportunity to tour the East Coast in May! A full weekend of shows in New York, Baltimore, and Delaware is leading to more bookings in more cities, but before we can confirm any new gigs we need to raise some money for traveling, hotel, and other expenses. We also plan to work on new songs and perhaps even record a few in our East Coast friend’s studio. To that end, we’re very excited to offer you the chance to wrap your ears and eyes around some Flutterbies collectables and, in the process, to become co-sponsors of our tour and perhaps a producer on our next EP!
