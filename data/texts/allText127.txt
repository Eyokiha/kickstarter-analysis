Our goal is to create a platform for aspiring artists of all genres in which they can display their talents and "get featured". With social media as our tool (SoundCloud, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouNow) and our own website (www.meltedcrayonsentertainment.com) we are able to help promote and at the same time entertain people of all ages. Melted Crayons Entertainment not only provides artists the platform and venue but we also have signed artists (K0RM13R & SUperB) who will be preforming live(free) on-line. With user support and amazing feedback to this point we are positive we can continue to Grow, Expand and Evolve. With your donation we will be including a personal thank you video message!! We are truly passionate about what we do and with help from you we will be able to provide better performances to our live viewers. Risks and challenges Through our trial run and research we have determined that our only challenges are cost of licensing, equipment and required services such as our gear to perform and our software and ISP to run our webpage. We are able to reach a large enough number of people/viewers to garner advertising partnerships and look to use this as well as sales of our Fan Packs to create enough revenue to make this possible. Our risk is that we grow too fast not being able to keep up with the demand. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
