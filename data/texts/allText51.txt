The funds raised for this project will be used to purchase the necessary equipment for taking aerial video and photography like you just watched.

This fund is supplementing my resources to take my photography skills airborne!I am a college student at the University of Missouri - Columbia that is looking for a unique way to market my talents in video and photo editing to finance the rest of my college experience and launch a business based on this new technology.
