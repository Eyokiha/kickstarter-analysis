Sharing memories, remembering the great times and celebrating one's life should not come at such a cost !! As many of you will understand the price of losing a loved one has become unbearable. Their should not be such a strain or price tag on sending your beloved to their final resting place. IT HAS BECOME UNFORTUNATE - FOR THE UNFORTUNATE... Many families are placed in financial debt due to their unfortunate loss while other families just do not have the resources to even attempt it and the government is forced to intervene. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL !! After seeing first hand how it works when a loved one passes away it is evident that there is a definite need for somewhere people can go and properly celebrate their life and death without the cost and worry about keeping up with the Jones.
