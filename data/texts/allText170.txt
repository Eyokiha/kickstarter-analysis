I have three CDs out as Four Dimensional Nightmare, and would like to do something different for #4. I have decided to choose 10-14 of my songs that already exist as rough recordings, remix them, have them mastered and produced as hard copies (as well as available for download). Costs will include use of mixing equipment, art for the cover, back and inner, mastering and producing the final product. I believe the cost will be more than $300, but I want to make the goal reachable. Risks and challenges Every step of the process will have to occur at a quality level high enough to meet my expectations, as well as those of my fans. And there are several steps - the initial remixing is the most critical aspect, as that is where the creative and visionary process occurs. I do have equipment and people set up to assist me in this if necessary. I also will need to find an artist who is affordable, yet talented, to create the all-important artwork to make this stand out. Mastering is critical, as well, to the overall quality of the recordings once all of the remixing has been completed. I do have someone lined up for this who I trust to do a great job, but it is definitely crucial. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
