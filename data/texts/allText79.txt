I will be returning to NYC in November to run my 3rd NYC Marathon.The NYC marathon was my first marathon in 2011 and I will continue to run it for as long as I can. Race day in NYC is like no other day in the big city. Thousands of people line the streets to cheer and support the runners. The volunteers, choirs, bands, residents, all show so much love on this day. It is a day full of excitement, joy, and triumph! I feel that the only way to capture the true beauty of the day is to snap as many pictures as I can on race day and make a photo book. I have never made a photo book before, but I will attempt to create a Professional Coffee Table Hard Cover type book. The funds from kickstarter will help with the expenses for the race entry ($3000) and also to create the photo book(s). The money from this project will not be used for travel expenses (that is already covered!). Risks and challenges The risks and challenges of completing this project are; 1. I can get injured and not be able to run the marathon 2. My battery dies and cannot take pictures. I will tackle them by: 1. I am an experienced runner, I have completed many marathons and half marathons and I will complete the 2014 NYC marathon no matter what, even if I have to walk the entire way. 2. I will carry a backup battery case for my phone and will carry a mini camera in my running belt. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
