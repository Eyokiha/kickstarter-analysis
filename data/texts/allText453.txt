This is what we do now at home but we like to bring to more people in the city. This is why we want to rent a place in sun valley to setup a small restaurant, so more people can enjoy the taste of this popular Dutch product.This can also be served with fried rise with garlic and served with fresh vegetables , so that you can have this as a complete meal or as a bite in the afternoon.We will also start in the future with delivery at home or businesses and at party's.Right now are we the only one putting this there in the market . Risks and challenges we think that the risks are so small because we are the only one in town with this product Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
