We have already been to Los Angeles once for an in-depth photo weekend. Areas we photographed included parts of downtown, Westwood Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Venice, Santa Monica Pier, and Hollywood.On this final visit, we will cover West Hollywood, Forest Home Cemetery, the Hollywood Hills, the Warner Bros studio backlot, Mt. Lee (the Hollywood sign), Union Station, Chinatown and several other areas.The end result will be a full color book, softbound, published, size 8.5"x 8.5" Risks and challenges We have already completed more than half of the principal photography, and we have constructed a prototype of the book for publication. We feel that any challenges to completing the project have already been overcome during our first visit. Sample photos are available to potential backers. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
