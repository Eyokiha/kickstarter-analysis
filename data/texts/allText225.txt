My new album is already in production but I am looking for the final push that will see it through in time for the holidays! Miracles, Menorah and Moses has been a goal of mine for many years and I am excited to get these songs and messages out to children and families everywhere!As it stands now I am recording with spare time in a home studio, so my hope is that with the funds raised here I can finish this project with the proper focus it deserves. My needs include; a few paid studio musicians, 6-7 recording days, professional mixing and mastering, a package to press and artwork to release 500-1,000 copies. Thank You,DavidAddendum: David Grover has performed at the White House, the Goodwill Games, The Today Show, the Detroit Symphony and the United Nations. To hear this living legend is to instantly become a "Grover Groupie". This prolific singer songwriter ‘s Chanukah At Grover’s Corner (featuring Theodore Bikel) received a Regional Emmy and has been played on PBS Stations at holiday time for years. David’s original Jewish Holiday Songs have become a staple for such venues as The Jewish Museum as well as Synagogues, JCC’s and Jewish Day Schools and Camps around the country.
