Arab-American comedian and writer Amer Zahr is producing the fourth annual installment of the project he founded, the "1001 Laughs Dearborn Comedy Festival."This year's version is more expanded than ever, featuring SEVENTEEN comedians! Even more, this year's lineup features more diversity than you could imagine, with artists who are black, white, Arab, Native American, & more!And in today's world, we want to show Trump that we still know how to laugh! And we need to do as many shows as possible before we all get deported...Like years past, this festival will be held in Dearborn at the Arab American National Museum, in the heart of Arab America's center!But more expansion means more costs, and we need your support to make this festival as successful as possible. Risks and challenges A festival like this requires a lot of time and effort in production and logistics. Amer has successfully produced shows at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. Your support will help to cover travel and lodging costs for the artists. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
