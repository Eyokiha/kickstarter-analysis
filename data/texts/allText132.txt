Wanting to make an album and actually putting forth the effort are two different things.. You find that out quickly in music or even in life for that matter everyone needs to put forth an effort for things they really want. I want to create something fresh and unique, a body of work I can truly be proud of. I've been a part of many projects spanning different genres and this time its my project. I will be pressing vinyl up for the first time on a project and I'm excited to bring you this collection of rarity and a piece of history. I appreciate all the love and support I've been getting from friends, family fans and brands that have rocked with me!#Cheers!
