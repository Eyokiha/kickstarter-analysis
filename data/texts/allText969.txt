Hello there! I'm a teacher certified in CT and MA. I have a Master's in Education and experience PK-12 including Special Ed. I want to connect qualified teachers and specialists to the the right schools. My site matches based on location and degree held. And candidates are notified when the position of interest is open, interviewing, and filled all on your account. No need to be checking emails and district sites constantly! Those who served in AmeriCorps and in the military will also have the opportunity to stand out. Please help bring the site to life so we can bring the best educators to your community!
