Places and People will be a brief Journal based off the adventures of my travels in the Western United States. This short story will be composed of various stories, photographs, and separate videos to give the reader incite into what one may experience while traveling across the U.S. The stories may be small and the photos may not look professional, but the impact that they will have on my life will be explained. I can't promise that any of this will be professional, but the is a point to all of this. This is an account of experiences that many people are not able to have and I want to be able to inspire people to take a chance and explore the world and see what is out there. I will document my travels via photography and videos. During my time traveling I will be keeping a field journal to keep track of the people we meet and the places we visit. I know that this seems like i just want to go on vacation with your money,but its not. It is something that i will create so that I can help spread the word that there is more to life than just doing boring things. I know that if you truly understand my goal you will fall in love with this idea. So please help me help you. Please help me reach my goal so that I may hopefully create something that can change peoples lives. If you have any Questions, Concerns, or Comments please feel free to email me. Risks and challenges The challenges that will accompany this project will be that we will always be on the road. Moving from place to place, hiking from point to point. Climbing to get to a great place just to get a perfect picture to make all of this come together. It is very draining on the human body. But to be able to make something of this kind work and to be able to have people appreciate it is why we do it. That's why in the end its so worth it! Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
