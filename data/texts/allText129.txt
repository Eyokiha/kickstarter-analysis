This album means everything to me. I've got a testimony I need to let the world know. I believe god protected me from signing with the enemy. I'm very thankful for this opportunity of bringing my talents to be of use to god's kingdom. This will be my Record Label's 1st Full Length Album. Proclaiming His name & Declaring War on the Comatose Spirit within our city, I encourage everyone who believes in this change & believes in Christ to allow me the chance to prove he is moving through our city! GOD & his Son would like nothing more than to have his rightful relationship with “you”! Are you going to let him in? If so, respond & give me the opportunity to convey all that I can in this Album!!!! Risks and challenges The only issue I could foresee at this moment is timeframe. I've got to be able to dedicate allot of time to this project because it's extremely important. I feel this will be overcome because I have never had an issue getting anything I put my mind to completed. As an orphan this trait is critical to survival. I will get this project completed because everyone is depending on me to expose the truth about this part of reality. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
