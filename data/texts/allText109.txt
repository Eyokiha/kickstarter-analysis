The funds gathered with this project will cover a trip cost, equipments and materials costs aswell as creation of my special gift to everyone participating and supporting me. The main idea is to travel to a footsteps of a brave gentlemans from London to New York and back to London. London, United Kingdom to Suez, Egypt - rail and steamer across the Mediterranean Sea 7 days Suez to Bombay, India steamer across the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean 13 days Bombay to Calcutta, India rail 3 days Calcutta to Victoria, Hong Kong steamer across the South China Sea 13 days Hong Kong to Yokohama, Japan steamer across the South China Sea, East China Sea, and the Pacific Ocean 6 days Yokohama to San Francisco, United States steamer across the Pacific Ocean 22 days San Francisco to New York City, United States rail 7 days New York to London steamer across the Atlantic Ocean and rail 9 days So, this was the general traveling plan in the book. Considering that nowadays the trip itself will take less time i will spend the rest of the time filming and photographing the most amazing places. I will create a Twitter and post a journey footage to a vblog every day. I am planning the trip during the 2015 summer, so the weather will be mostly nice and warm. I will try to follow most of the adventure tides, like renting an elephant in India. This will be a simple start to gather experience for a future projects even more complex. Risks and challenges To avoid possible risks i will invite a small group of proffesionals to help with an equipment and footage. As i am a photographer there should be no problem with photography on my side if i will have all the needed equipment and tools. I am a vigorous traveler with strong passion to exploration. I am not afrraid to face chalenges on my way. Please comment, ask questions, send feedbacks, request a report. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
