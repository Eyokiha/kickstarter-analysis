Squinting your eyes under the dim light, you can make up the improbable form of a pig with wings. It is glorious. “We are Pigasus. Mighty game developers”, asserts the airborne swine, “And this here is Adventurezator”.“Adventurezator is an adventure game. Well, sort of. You see, we all love adventure games (as all sentient beings in their right minds should) but you must admit that even the best of them lack something very special: good old YOU.”“In Adventurezator, you not only play an ever-renewed pile of brilliantly designed point-and-click adventures: you actually get to design your own, and publish them too! The best part? You can do that without all that boring programming, or math. It’s all very technical, but (if we had to put it in layman’s terms) it works like a very fancy cable connected directly to your brilliance.”You stare at the flying mammal for a while, barely containing your happiness. But still, you could use a little more detailed information. Something like a description and a gameplay video. Maybe with reward levels. Or a teaser video. Pigasus opens its inventory and gladly gives all of this to you, and more.Starting with this here Intro Teaser, which was entirelly made with with the Cutscene Creator, within the Adventurezator itself! How cool is that? ____________________________________________________________________ That's all nice and sweet, "but I still don't know what the games will actually play like" you may say. Fear not, backer, we've got you covered: ____________________________________________________________________ In this world of ever-shrinking attention spans, and an ever-growing amount of crap on the internets, we are told time and again by the so-called carriers of wisdom that our videos must be short and our descriptions to the point, or our potential backers will soon look away. Nonsense, we cry! They are here to decide on spending real money! They are here to help develop an amazing game - no, millions of amazing user-created amazing games! They are here to write history! It's our responsibility to show them everything they need to know! (Well that, and the fact that the Adventurezator is not easy to demonstrate in 3 minutes, and we are not "camera-ready [golden] sex gods" like Tim Schafer, makes us want to show you a bit more of what we have)So we present you with a short video of the Sandbox Tools of the Adventurezator: ____________________________________________________________________ On the single player campaign When Pigs Fly, you will play the adventures of Edmund, the human-turned-pigman while he tries to become a human again, and his sidekick Zookwinkle the Gnome. In this tale of courage, intrigue, betrayal (and dumbness) - you and our pseudo-heroes will face many challenges and re-write history while they are at it: meet Isaac Newton, the Seven Dwarfs, and even Weeping Angels (holy crap!). Your actions will decide the fate of many, with 3 different endings (maybe 4), some of which will make you laugh, others will make you cry - okay that was probably exaggerated, but they will make you smile and re-play some levels to see the other outcomes, we guarantee!____________________________________________________________________ Here a nifty image to help you visualize exactly what you are getting with each reward tier: Reward Tiers And here are the Tees and Poster designs we have to far. We are planning on adding at least 3 more poster designs - they will all be related to levels inside the main campaign: Tees and Posters - current designs ____________________________________________________________________ The base goal money with be used mostly to give us a couple more months of extra polish, debugging, and release trailer, to make sure we have a smooth game on release.Expansion Packs: Although we are confident we will have a great game for release, given the nature of the Adventurezator, more content is very welcome. We hope the Adventurezator will have a rather long 'shelf'-life, and plan on developing several content packs and expansions after release. If we reach any expansion pack funding via this kickstarter, all backers that got a digital copy will also get such expansions when they are released for free.Mobile Client: We are also planning on porting the game (without the sandbox and editing tools) to Android and IOs, to enable you to enjoy that infinite well of adventure games on the go - as well as have your friends and family play the adventures you make on the cheap (we still don't know how cheap). We have already taken steps since the beginning of development to make sure this can be done without too much trouble (hopefully...). Mobile clients will also be totally free for backers if we reach it's funding goal.PAX East: We'd love to be able to go to PAX East in March and mingle with all of you awesome backers, but for a company based in Brazil, travel expenses can be brutal.

We believe our videos have shown our competence and the quality of the game we are creating. We already have an advanced version of the game, and will start alpha testing in a couple of months. As with every complex game project, unexpected situations may mean we miss the deadline, but we are confident that we'll be able to deliver the game on time, and we plan to keep adding more features and content post-release. We'll also will keep the backers informed on the progress of development with a monthly update. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
