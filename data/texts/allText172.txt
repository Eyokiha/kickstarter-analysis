The tour:This party would be the first of it's kind. We planed a European Tour of MUSA Underground Movement; and album presentation, MUSA Rec; We will have an event per weekend around Europe. The main dates will be at London 12/05/2012 MUSA underground movement presentation, Frankfurt 15/06/2013 Album and MUSA Rec. presentation, and Ibiza 13/09/2013.Our Vision: A new kind of party developing individual expression and interpersonal relationships. Combining aromatherapy, visual animation, and a great selection of music we promote positive interaction and well being for all our guests, making for an unforgettable experience. The music policy is minimal and deep house with an emphasis on soulful basslines, understated melodies and intelligent rhythm all mixed with a selection of the best electronic music classics mixed by a brilliant Djs/Producers team of the underground scene. A performer is working with our guests, inspiring them to put their own creative ideas on the canvasses we provide. Face and body painting is also offered. Aromatherapy, incenses and essential oils are used to create a unique atmosphere, tailored to the musical and artistic elements.The money will be used in production, organization, logistics and artist of each event. As well as the finance of the personal involved live events manager or PR, as well as, the marketing.The album:We are making an album, double LP and digital distributed. Be assured that your money will be allocated wisely - licensing advances for the artists and labels featured, mechanical royalties, artwork & sleeve design, production and manufacture, postage and packaging. Plus, we have to pay people to actually do the licensing and contracting for us, mastering engineers to make it sound perfect and maybe even some PR people so we can spread the word about what could potentially be a game changing concept. And thats an exciting thing to be part of right?In exchange for your support in making this happen, you, the pledger has the opportunity to secure all sorts of exciting and exclusive rewards from signed copies of the album (a double CD no less), your name featured in the Thank You section of the album credits and exclusive T shirts featuring fancy artwork from those awesome designers Neighbour (down in that there London) right through to one-to-one DJ lessons, VIP nights out or even a private party for you and all your friends.
