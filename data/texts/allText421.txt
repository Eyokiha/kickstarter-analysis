Gankfu is a platform that takes gamers and gaming to the next level. It's a way to connect neighbors and create new friendships. The main idea behind Gankfu is to be able, by a simple click of a button, to find and connect with people nearby that have similar gaming interests. Therefore, the goal here is simple and original: "Meet neighbors that like the same games as you".Gankfu is an innovative idea, the first platform to allow gamers to find, connect and meet neighbors with similar gaming taste regardless of the gaming platform used. Connecting with people means making new friends, real ones. Who knows that new friend can also be the players long searched for soul mate.The service will first be launched as a website and then as an IOS and android app. The investment we will receive will help develop a user friendly interface. A big part of the website is ready, we will be ready to launch as soon as design is finalized. Risks and challenges Our biggest challenge is to get people on our platform and for that we need your help in order to invest in advertising campaigns which will take place in New York, Paris and another capital of the highest bidders choice ! Another challenge we will have is also getting in contact with big game providers to have them help us connect people. We are not here to sell games we are here to get gamers new friends and teammates. In the era of Eports and MMO's every gamer needs the best help he can find to compete in the digital world!
