WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVEThe aim of this game, is to portray the strong subject matter that the film is closely based upon. The filmmakers behind A Mugs Game want to share the harsh realities of not just the negative effects of drugs, but the social, political, emotional and physical issues that drugs and particularly 'Methadrone' had caused in such a small space of time. We want our audiences to learn something new, for some can relate to the characters and the stories they are involved in.The whole point of this film is to take away a strong message, learn and realise, appreciate and as equally important, to entertain. So get involved and be a part of a movie that carries meaning and drives to make a statement about something a little different and important to many people.

After our 2 screenings of the promo we shot for A Mugs Game, we have come to realise that there is huge potential for education and anti drugs campaigns. When the feature film is in production, additional platforms can be used for a variety of health trusts and organisations and education.

Risks and challenges We take the whole process of making our first 90 minute feature debut very seriously. It will be a huge challenge to get it right, but with everyone's help from backers to production crew but we love a challenge, its one of the reasons that makes it so much fun. We understand the craft and we share the determination in getting the story told and shown to the masses and achieving our goal. The risks? Well, one that been set in the back of all our minds is, "will people understand what we are trying to say?". We don't to miss understood as a glossy 'Skins' homage. But the film will carry the right message across. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
