In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy was the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. The very first moments after the mega storm winds calmed down a little bit I went out in the streets of New York City to immortalize an unreal moment of the City's history. I was totally alone, nobody outside. A strong gust of wind snatched my professional camera and broke it down on the sidewalk. I decided to continue the adventure armed with my iPhone only, 85% battery. I walked down from the 80's to end of the island in financial district. I took unique pictures of Manhattan empty of people, silent and shocked. 58th street, the crane moment Pictures appeared to be in good quality enough to print them big scale. Once I showed the work to an art gallery which told me to print them and expose them. They fell in love with the lone iPhone photographer story :) Swimming pool at York Plaza Thus, I decided to raise money in order to print the pictures in large scale on acrylic and expose them in galleries in New York and in couple of places in Europe. The second step of this project will be to take pictures of the same places but packed with people, with a lot of colors, life and motion. I will put pictures two by two, close to another, to create the most creative contrast, showing silence and desolation versus joy and life. It is the demonstration that life can be two sided and you can always decide which side you want to see. It's a matter of choice....
