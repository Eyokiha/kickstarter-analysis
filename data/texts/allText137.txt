HELP STAG HARE LAUNCH A SMALL BATCH RECORD LABEL!!!This is a fundraiser to create a limited run of WHITE 12" LP's of the STAG HARE album ANGEL TECH, (released on Cassette by Space Slave Editions November 26th of 2013). It will be the first of a continuing series of LP's on my own imprint which will be called DJRONA and sold off my website STAG-HARE.NET. So this is a fundraiser first for the ANGEL TECH LP, but also to help get the DJRONA label running as well.WHY VINYL RECORDS?I am very excited about ANGEL TECH, and believe it will make an excellent addition to any vinyl collection. I also wish to make something unique for those of you who are followers of the Stag Hare project as well as something which has more of a physical presence than digital audio files. Stag Hare for me has always been about music and sound, but also about visual elements and performance elements and so it is important to me, for a more full representation of this project, to have a more solid physical anchor for the music, which is where this record comes into play. I wish to make the LP a collectors item. Also I love the idea that if the electricity ever went down vinyl records can still be played while digital files cannot.... or you could take a wind up record player with you into the woods and listen to the record in your secret forest yurt without electricity.DRONES CASSETTEThe DRONES cassette will be available strictly to kickstarter backers. It will be a c45 professional dubbed cassette of new Stag Hare material recorded over the past 3 years. WHY CONTRIBUTE?Your money would, first and foremost, be getting you a copy of ANGEL TECH on vinyl, and/or the DRONES cassette. But it would also and most importantly be contributing towards the Stag Hare and DJRONA label project at large, enabling me to self-fund more records, videos, etc in the future. I have always envisioned all the Stag Hare albums as part of a continuing series, being able to release albums myself makes this so much more possible! It is also important for me to have as direct a connection with listeners as possible. This is only possible through self releasing my albums. I believe that getting funding for the ANGEL TECH LP will put me a good step in the right direction of being able to perpetuate more upcoming releases. I would love to eventually release for the first time on vinyl albums from the Stag Hare back catalog such as BLACK MEDICINE MUSIC, AHSPEN and SANDPAINTINGS. I have also already begun the work on a number of more albums which will follow up ANGEL TECH as collectible vinyl releases as soon as possible. Your support will be helping me make this dream come true. ABOUT THE ALBUMThe tracks were all recorded starting in 2010 and completed towards the end of 2013. Some layers and parts are older, some newer. The recordings took place in a number of locations as I moved around a lot during those years. Parts were recorded in Salt Lake City, Portland Oregon, New York City, and ultimately finished back in Salt Lake City. The final mixes and finishing touches as well as the overall structure of the album came together in September of 2013 shortly following the birth of my son Sebastian. The timing caught me by surprise as the tracks sort of all came together suddenly. The album concerns itself with intersections of the profane with the holy, secular with the religious, divine with the desolate. It is about seeing the ancient ritual and meaning in the contemporary and mundane. It is exploring the joyous being tragic, and the depression being beauty. It is intended to be a mythological series of folktales, simultaneously leading the listener through a series of archetypal ritual patterns while coloring the environment (being the room the music is listened to, or the internal space created through headphone listening) with a particularly placed and tuned series of tones and textures. It is meant to be decorative as well as functional.

I have been working on the Stag Hare project for about 6 years and am continually striving for a consistency in quality and focus. I am excited to expand the project into more music releases, performances and videos and installations relating to the project to unfold in the future.Besides Stag Hare I have been involved in a number of other music projects, including Seven Feathers Rainwater, Ariel, River Spirit Dragon, and Baug. I am also a film programmer for the Salt Lake City Film Festival and am working on a number of short film and video projects.

I will certainly do everything in my power to get everything on it's way by then, but I know oftentimes the turnaround time for an LP pressing can be longer than anticipated.
