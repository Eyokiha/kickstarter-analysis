Visions of Love is a roaring comedy about two lounge singers performing their final show together. Earl, one half of the duo, is a depressed romantic determined to win back Milly, his ex-wife and musical partner, who is now dating Mickey, a 15 year-old high school sophomore. Milly and Mickey, are fleeing to Tijuana to elope, and it is up to Earl to prove to Milly that he is a real man. The entire performance ends with an explosive barroom brawl. We will be shooting for two days in The Delancey, a bar/venue in SoHo. We have a brilliant and talented cast and crew, and are SUPER EXCITED to get shooting on April 16th. We will be recording the songs beforehand, and so will have a couple of songs for an OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK! But we need a little more than excitement ad dedication to get this HILARIOUS project made! And that's where YOU come in! We still need to raise funds for: - Payment for the Location - Stunt Coordinator - Music Rights - Art Direction With your help you can become part of something truly spectacular! A MUSICAL COMEDY that will be sure to tickle and offend in the best ways. So please, help us Obi-Wan Kenobi's... You are our only hopes!
