This project is a labour of love for me, I have spent 20 years of my life growing up in the Swan Valley and am aiming to exhibit my life through the eye of a camera lens which focuses on and draws in the people and places which make up the fabric of the valley. This project is to seek backing so that I can afford the gear and printing costs which I will need in order to be able to put this exhibition together in September 2015. I am seeking to raise funds for this project in order to purchase a DSLR which is more suited to the size and quality of prints that I am trying to produce as well as 3 lenses which cover the bases of wide angle photography, portrait photography and a 50mm Prime lens which is my personal favourite to shoot with. The remainder of the funds raised will go towards printing and framing costs which are expected to come to around 45% of the target raised.I will be spending significant time over the coming 10 months capturing the highs, lows and very nature of the Swan Valley and showcasing the people and places that make this place one of the most beautiful places to live in the world.I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have and I hope that you can find something to pledge to help me make this dream a reality! Risks and challenges The challenges I have with this project will be time, many of the places I want to capture only work in very certain lighting and finding the time in a busy schedule will be difficult. One of the big risks as well is that I am dependent on Local Government in actually organising the launch of the official exhibition and that may delay the project dependent on the booking status of my local galleries.
