Paintbox Media ltd is a fresh, new multimedia company that offers a variety of services within the creative and performing arts. We want to open a photographic studio within the heart of South Wales. We have identified a building we want to use but need help to cover the initial set up costs. These include; rental bond, up front rent and admin fees incurred from the letting agent. We had a studio lined up and within budget but unfortunately we were let down. Our new studio will be accessible to all within the creative industry as well as being able to house everything Paintbox Media offers. Without a permanent premises we are unable to offer the skills and services we are good at, we also have to pay rental out of our pockets to hire other studios. As well as standard roller backdrops we intend to have movable sets similar to those used on tv as then the studio can become multi-functional and we can offer film services too. It also means we are in a position to regularly change the backdrops available for studio hire keeping the venue fresh and exciting. As soon as we have the finances in place to secure the building we aim to open the studio within 1 week as all sets, lighting and props are ready. The studio will be available for shoots, individual hire, community projects, training and camera club events. Pledge rewards are available and all donors names will be added to a plaque inside the main entrance. Many thanks, Sally www.paintboxmedia.uk Risks and challenges Overhead costs have been worked out and we know that we are able to cover them on just the bare minimum of projects. Should we be unable to secure the building we really want, we do have a back up venue of the same price but a little smaller. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
