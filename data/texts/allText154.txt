I've been producing music as a hobby since 2002. I was listening to some rap music and I was really focusing in on the beats and how simple they were. I thought that it would be really easy to make them if I just had the proper equipment...within weeks I started the arduous task of becoming a completely self taught producer. After over a decade I have my craft honed down to a science classified as art; like natural fractals my music keeps going and only becomes more mesmerizing the more you look into it. I have over 500 nearly finished tracks that I would like to narrow down to 100 fully-produced marvels of modern music. I don't want to get famous or rich, I just want to share my passion with the world. Risks and challenges I'm currently a sophomore honor student in college earning my AS in business. I'm not just a creative force but I also posess keen business sense and marketing strategies. Since I have the summer off from classes now is absolutely the best time to complete this project. Not only is most of the groundwork already laid, as the tracks just need minor tweaks and mastering, but the venue and mediums to release the albums await with open arms. Some may say that a challenge is competing against other, perhaps more talented musicians but I think people are always interested in hearing something new, unique, and interesting.
