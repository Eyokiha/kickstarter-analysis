When hurricane Ike hit my hometown of Houston, we did not have water or electricity for close to 2 weeks. I could only imagine what the poor residents of Louisiana had just gone through with Hurricane Katrina. As we searched everywhere for gas, food and water, I thought that there should be a better way to communicate the availability of these before making the huge lines only later to find out that supplies were gone and that we had also run out of gas! At the time, the Iphone/smartphone had not been out, but we did have cell phones, so this was the only way to communicate with my friends and loved ones what was available and where. After the invention of the Iphone, and after seeing more terrible disasters like the Japan earthquake, the idea of a website that could help people Post up-to-the-minute SOS messages for FREE came to mind. I would start with Houston and as the website grows, I would expand nationwide and then maybe, even other countries. Now, I am a stay-at-home mom with limited knowledge of web development, but with the right web developer and hard work, the crazy ideas that are in my head may just help those Incaseofsos! Risks and challenges Building a website such as this will require a lot of time and technical expertise. Finding a Web Developer that can actually even create this seems daunting, but I know is possible (Craiglist?). I have secured the domain site. I would like to launch it by December 2016, or sooner if possible. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
