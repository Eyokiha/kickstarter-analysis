Lettstry.comWe are here to send letters and stories. Short, long, for you, for a friend, for an enemy--we'll do it all. Well, that's the plan anyways. We will send a letter or story with a specified word limit to anyone of your choosing... including yourself, of course!We think this is a great and fun idea to bring joy to people all around the world. The funds that will be raised for this project will primarily go hiring creative writers to write the letters and stories! Also, the funds will help expand the website and develop it to be more professional. Risks and challenges There are not too many risks! Just spreading the word is all it takes for this project to take off. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
