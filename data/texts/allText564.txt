Help us finish the film Day of the Year! It is an original and creative film that is different than anything you have seen come out of Utah before. We have half of the film shot right now and hope to shoot the rest before the end of the year. With the help of our original investors we will be able to eventually have enough money for post production and premiering the film in Utah next year. Day of the Year features some fantastic talent from all across Utah and from LA including UVU, BYU, U of U grads, professional actors and crew. We have lined up some great bands and music for the soundtrack and want to promote the great artistic scene that is in Utah. It is a film with a unique and original story line that has been in development for two years. We hope to complete the film by next summer, premier the film in Utah, and are exited to take it to festivals.We appreciate your help and are confident that our backers will be proud of the finished product. Risks and challenges The major risks and challenges with this project is execution. A lot goes in to making a film of this quality and our production team has been able to provide a great experience for our actors and our crew so far, while delivering a great product. Scheduling and continuity will become a problem for us if we are not able to get the money in time to film soon. We are determined to finish the product though and will pay close attention to footage we already have to make sure things match. Are hardest shoots are behind us and we need a few more days to complete the film. Learn about accountability on Kickstarter
